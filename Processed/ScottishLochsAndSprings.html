<p class="first">No work giving a comprehensive account of Well-worship
in Scotland has yet appeared. Mr. R. C. Hope&rsquo;s recent volume,
&ldquo;<i>Holy Wells: Their Legends and Traditions</i>,&rdquo;
discusses the subject in its relation to England. In the following
pages an attempt has been made to illustrate the more outstanding facts
associated with the cult north of the Tweed. Various holy wells are
referred to by name; but the list makes no claim to be exhaustive.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In glancing at the superstitions connected with
Scottish lochs and springs, we are called upon to scan a chapter of our
social history not yet closed. A somewhat scanty amount of information
is available to explain the origin and growth of such superstitions,
but enough can be had to connect them with archaic nature-worship. In
the dark dawn of our annals <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>much confusion existed among our
ancestors concerning the outer world, which so strongly appealed to
their senses. They had very vague notions regarding the difference
between what we now call the Natural and the Supernatural. Indeed all
nature was to them supernatural. They looked on sun, moon, and star, on
mountain and forest, on river, lake, and sea as the abodes of
divinities, or even as divinities themselves. These divinities, they
thought, could either help or hurt man, and ought therefore to be
propitiated. Hence sprang certain customs which have survived to our
own time. Men knocked at the gate of Nature, but were not admitted
within. From the unknown recesses there came to them only tones of
mystery.</p>
<p>In ancient times water was deified even by such civilised nations as
the Greeks and Romans, and to-day it is revered as a god by untutored
savages. Sir John Lubbock, in his &ldquo;<i>Origin of
Civilisation</i>,&rdquo; shows, by reference to the works of
travellers, what a hold this cult still has in regions where the
natives have not yet risen above the polytheistic stage of religious
development. Dr. E. B. Tylor forcibly remarks, in his
&ldquo;<i>Primitive Culture</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;What ethnography has to
teach of that great element of the religion of mankind, the worship of
well and lake, brook and river, is simply this&mdash;that what is
poetry to us was philosophy to early man; that to his mind water acted
not by laws of force, but by life and will; that the water-spirits of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>prim&aelig;val mythology are as souls which cause
the water&rsquo;s rush and rest, its kindness and its cruelty; that,
lastly, man finds in the beings which, with such power, can work him
weal and woe, deities with a wider influence over his life, deities to
be feared and loved, to be prayed to and praised, and propitiated with
sacrificial gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In speaking of inanimate objects, we often ascribe life to them; but
our words are metaphors, and nothing more. At an earlier time such
phrases expressed real beliefs, and were not simply the outcome of a
poetic imagination. Keats, in one of his Sonnets, speaks of</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The moving waters at their priest-like task</p>
<p class="line">Of pure ablution round Earth&rsquo;s human
shore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here he gives us the poetical and not the actual
interpretation of a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>We may, if we choose, talk of the worship of water as a creed
outworn, but it is still with us, though under various disguises. Under
the form of rites of divination practised as an amusement by young
persons, such survivals often conceal their real origin. The history of
superstition teaches us with what persistence pagan beliefs hold their
ground in the midst of a Christian civilisation. Martin, who visited
the Western Islands at the close of the seventeenth century, found how
true this was in many details of daily life. A custom connected with
ancient sea-worship had been popular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>among the inhabitants of Lewis till
about thirty-years before his visit, but had been suppressed by the
Protestant clergy on account of its pagan character. This was an annual
sacrifice at Hallow-tide to a sea god called Shony. Martin gives the
following account of the ceremony:&mdash;&ldquo;The inhabitants round
the island came to the church of St. Mulvay, having each man his
provision along with him; every family furnished a peck of malt, and
this was brewed into ale; one of their number was picked out to wade
into the sea up to the middle, and, carrying a cup of ale in his hand,
standing still in that posture, cried out with a loud voice, saying,
&lsquo;Shony, I give you this cup of ale, hoping that you&rsquo;ll be
so kind as to send us plenty of sea-ware for enriching our ground the
ensuing year,&rsquo; and so threw the cup of ale into the sea. This was
performed in the night-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sailors and fishermen still cherish superstitions of their own.
Majesty is not the only feature of the changeful ocean that strikes
them. They are keenly alive to its mystery and to the possibilities of
life within its depths. Strange creatures have their home there, the
mighty sea serpent and the less formidable mermen and mermaidens. Among
the Shetland islands mer-folk were recognised denizens of the sea, and
were known by the name of Sea-trows.</p>
<p>These singular beings dwelt in the caves of ocean, and came up to
disport themselves on the shores of the islands. A favourite haunt of
theirs was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>Ve Skerries, about seven miles north-west of
Papa-Stour. They usually rose through the water in the shape of seals,
and when they reached the beach they slipped off their skins and
appeared like ordinary mortals, the females being of exceeding beauty.
If the skins could be snatched away on these occasions, their owners
were powerless to escape into the sea again. Sometimes these creatures
were entangled in the nets of fishermen or were caught by hooks. If
they were shot when in seal form, a tempest arose as soon as their
blood was mingled with the water of the sea. A family living within
recent times was believed to be descended from a human father and a
mermaid mother, the man having captured his bride by stealing her
seal&rsquo;s skin. After some years spent on land this sea lady
recovered her skin, and at once returned to her native element. The
members of the family were said to have hands bearing some resemblance
to the forefeet of a seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the old mythological existences of Scotland,&rdquo;
remarks Hugh Miller, in his &ldquo;<i>Scenes and Legends of the North
of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;there was none with whom the people of
Cromarty were better acquainted than with the mermaid. Thirty years
have not yet gone by since she has been seen by moonlight sitting on a
stone in the sea, a little to the east of the town; and scarcely a
winter passed, forty years earlier, in which she was not heard singing
among the rocks or seen braiding up her long yellow tresses on the
shore.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>The magical power ascribed to the sea is shown in an Orcadian witch
charm used in the seventeenth century. The charm had to do with the
churning of butter. Whoever wished to take advantage of it watched on
the beach till nine waves rolled in. At the reflux of the last the
charmer took three handfuls of water from the sea and carried them home
in a pail. If this water was put into the churn there would be a
plentiful supply of butter. Sea water was also used for curative
purposes, the patient being dipped after sunset. This charm was thought
to savour strongly of the black art. Allusion has been made above to
the rising of a storm in connection with the wounding of a sea-trow in
Shetland. According to an Orcadian superstition, the sea began to swell
whenever anyone with a piece of iron about him stept upon a certain
rock at the Noup Head of Westray. Not till the offending metal was
thrown into the water did the sea become calm again. Wallace, a
minister at Kirkwall towards the end of the seventeenth century,
mentions this belief in his &ldquo;<i>Description of the Isles of
Orkney</i>,&rdquo; and says that he offered a man a shilling to try the
experiment, but the offer was refused. It does not seem to have
occurred to him to make the experiment himself.</p>
<p>Among the ancient Romans the bull was sacred to Neptune, the sea
god, and was sacrificed in his honour. In our own country we find a
suggestion of the same rite, though in a modified form, in the custom
prevailing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>at one time of leading animals into the sea on
certain festivals. In the parish of Clonmany in Ireland it was formerly
customary on St. Columba&rsquo;s Day, the ninth of June, to drive
cattle to the beach and swim them in the sea near to where the water
from the Saint&rsquo;s well flowed in. In Scotland horses seem at one
time to have undergone a similar treatment at Lammas-tide. Dalyell, in
his &ldquo;<i>Darker Superstitions of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; mentions
that &ldquo;in July, 1647, the kirk-session of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s
Church, Edinburgh, resolved on intimating publicly &lsquo;that non goe
to Leith on Lambmes-day, nor tak their horses to be washed that day in
the sea.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A belief at one time existed that it was unlucky to rescue a
drowning man from the grasp of the sea. This superstition is referred
to by Sir Walter Scott in &ldquo;<i>The Pirate</i>,&rdquo; in the scene
where Bryce the pedlar warns Mordaunt against saving a shipwrecked
sailor. &ldquo;Are you mad,&rdquo; said the pedlar, &ldquo;you that
have lived sae lang in Zetland, to risk the saving of a drowning man?
Wot ye not, if you bring him to life again, he will be sure to do you
some capital injury?&rdquo; We discover the key to this strange
superstition in the idea entertained by savages that the person falling
into the water becomes the prey of the monster or demon inhabiting that
element; and, as Dr. Tylor aptly remarks, &ldquo;to save a sinking man
is to snatch a victim from the very clutches of the
water-spirit&mdash;a rash defiance of deity which would hardly pass
unavenged.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>Folklore thus brings us face to face with beliefs which owe their
origin to the primitive worship of the sea. It also allows us to catch
a glimpse of rivers, lakes, and springs as these were regarded by our
distant ancestors. When we remember that, according to a barbaric
notion, the current of a stream flows down along one bank and up along
the other, we need not be surprised that very crude fancies concerning
water at one time flourished in our land.</p>
<p>Even to us, with nineteenth-century science within reach, how
mysterious a river seems, as, in the quiet gloaming or in the grey
dawn, it glides along beneath overhanging trees, and how full of life
it is when, swollen by rain, it rushes forward in a resistless flood!
How much more awe-inspiring it must have been to men ignorant of the
commonest laws of Nature! Well might its channel be regarded as the
home of a spirit eager to waylay and destroy the too-venturesome
passer-by. Rivers, however, were not always reckoned the enemies of
man, for experience showed that they were helpful, as well as hurtful,
to him. The Tiber, for instance, was regarded with reverence by the
ancient inhabitants of Rome. Who does not remember the scene in one of
Macaulay&rsquo;s Lays, where, after the bridge has been hewn down to
block the passage of Lars Porsena and his host, the valiant Horatius
exclaims&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O Tiber! father Tiber!</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">To whom the Romans pray;</p>
<p class="line">A Roman&rsquo;s life, a Roman&rsquo;s arms,</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">Take thou in charge this day?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then with his harness on his back he plunges headlong into the
flood, and reaches the other side in safety.</p>
<p>In Christian art pagan symbolism continued long to flourish. Proof
of this bearing on the present subject is to be found in a mosaic at
Ravenna, of the sixth century, representing the baptism of Christ. The
water flows from an inverted urn, held by a venerable figure typifying
the river god of the Jordan, with reeds growing beside his head, and
snakes coiling around it.</p>
<p>In our own country healing virtue was attributed to water taken from
what was called a dead and living ford, <i>i.e.</i>, a ford where the
dead were carried and the living walked across. The same belief was
entertained with regard to the water of a south-running stream. The
patient had to go to the spot and drink the water and wash himself in
it. Sometimes his shirt was taken by another, and, after being dipped
in the south-running stream, was brought back and put wet upon him. A
wet shirt was also used as a Hallowe&rsquo;en charm to foretell its
owner&rsquo;s matrimonial future. The left sleeve of the shirt was to
be dipped in a river where &ldquo;three lairds&rsquo; lands met.&rdquo;
It was then to be hung up overnight before the fire. If certain rules
were attended to, the figure of the future spouse would appear and turn
the sleeve in order to dry the other side. In the Highlands the water
of a stream was used for purposes of sorcery till quite lately. When
any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>one wished evil to another he made a clay image of
the person to be injured, and placed it in a stream with the head of
the image against the current. It was believed that, as the clay was
dissolved by the water, the health of the person represented would
decline. The spell, however, would be broken if the image was
discovered and removed from the stream. In the counties of Sutherland
and Ross the practice survived till within the last few years. Near
Dunskey, in the parish of Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, is a stream which,
at the end of last century, was much resorted to by the credulous for
its health-giving properties. Visits were usually paid to it at the
change of the moon. It was deemed specially efficacious in the case of
rickety children, whose malady was then ascribed to witchcraft. The
patients were washed in the stream, and then taken to an adjoining
cave, where they were dried.</p>
<p>In modern poetry a river is frequently alluded to under the name of
its presiding spirit. Thus, in &ldquo;<i>Comus</i>,&rdquo; Milton
introduces Sabrina, a gentle nymph,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That with moist curb sways the smooth Severn
stream,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and tells us that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e755">&ldquo;The shepherds at their festivals</p>
<p class="line">Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays,</p>
<p class="line">And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream</p>
<p class="line">Of pansies, pinks, and gaudy daffodils.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Lakes have always held an important place in legendary
lore. Lord Tennyson has made us familiar with the part played by the
Lady of the Lake in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>Arthurian romance. Readers of the Idylls will
recollect it was she who gave to the king the jewelled sword Excalibur,
and who, on the eve of his passing, received it again. The wounded
Arthur thus addresses Sir Bedivere:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e755">&ldquo;Thou rememberest how,</p>
<p class="line">In those old days, one summer morn, an arm</p>
<p class="line">Rose up from out the bosom of the lake</p>
<p class="line">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</p>
<p class="line">Holding the sword&mdash;and how I row&rsquo;d
across</p>
<p class="line">And took it, and have worn it, like a king.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Scottish lochs form a striking feature in the
landscape, and must have been still more fitted to arrest attention in
ancient times when our land was more densely wooded than it is now. Dr.
Hugh Macmillan, in his &ldquo;<i>Holidays on High Lands</i>,&rdquo;
alludes to the differences in the appearance of our lochs. &ldquo;There
are moorland tarns,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;sullen and motionless as
lakes of the dead, lying deep in sunless rifts, where the very ravens
build no nests, and where no trace of life or vegetation is
seen&mdash;associated with many a wild tradition, accidents of straying
feet, the suicide of love, guilt, despair. And there are lochs
beautiful in themselves and gathering around them a world of beauty;
their shores fringed with the tasselled larch; their shallows
tesselated with the broad green leaves and alabaster chalices of the
water-lily, and their placid depths mirroring the crimson gleam of the
heather hills and the golden clouds overhead.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>Near the top of Mealfourvounie, in Inverness-shire, is a small lake
at one time believed to be unfathomable. How this notion arose it is
difficult to say, for when soundings were taken the depth was found to
be inconsiderable. In the parish of Penpont, Dumfriesshire, about a
mile to the south of Drumlanrig, is a small sheet of water called the
Dow, or Dhu Loch, <i>i.e.</i>, Black Loch. Till towards the end of last
century the spot was much frequented for its healing water. A personal
visit was not essential. When a deputy was sent he had to bring a
portion of the invalid&rsquo;s clothing and throw it over his left
shoulder into the loch. He then took up some water in a vessel which he
carefully kept from touching the ground. After turning himself round
sun-ways he carried the water home. The charm would be broken if he
looked back or spoke to anyone by the way. Among the people of the
district it was a common saying, when anyone did not respond to the
greeting of a passer-by, that he had been at the Dow Loch. Pilgrimages
to the loch seem to have been specially popular towards the close of
the seventeenth century, for in the year 1695 the Presbytery of Penpont
consulted the Synod of Dumfries about the superstitious practices then
current<span class="corr" id="xd26e791" title="Not in source">.</span>
The Synod, in response to the appeal, recommended the clergy of the
district to denounce from their pulpits such observances as heathenish
in character. There were persons still alive in the beginning of the
present century who had seen the offerings, left by the pilgrims,
floating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>on the loch or lying on its margin. To the
passer-by, ignorant of the superstitious custom, it might seem that a
rather untidy family washing was in progress.</p>
<p>The Church of St. Vigeans, in Forfarshire, is well known to
antiquaries in connection with its interesting sculptured stones. An
old tradition relates that the materials for the building were carried
by a water-kelpie, and that the foundations were laid on large bars of
iron. Underneath the structure was said to be a deep lake. The
tradition further relates that the kelpie prophesied that an incumbent
of the church would commit suicide, and that, on the occasion of the
first communion after, the church would sink into the lake. At the
beginning of the eighteenth century the minister of the parish did
commit suicide, and so strong was the superstition that the sacramental
rite was not observed till 1736. In connection with the event several
hundred people took up a position on a neighbouring rising ground to
watch what would happen. These spectators have passed away, but the
church remains.</p>
<p>St. Tredwell&rsquo;s Loch in Papa-Westray, Orkney, was at one time
very famous, partly from its habit of turning red whenever anything
striking was about to happen to a member of the Royal Family, and
partly from its power to work cures. On a small headland on the east of
the loch are still to be seen the ruins of St. Tredwell&rsquo;s Chapel,
measuring twenty-nine feet by twenty-two, with walls fully four feet in
thickness. On the floor-level about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>thirty copper coins were found
some years ago, the majority of them being of the reign of Charles the
Second. At the door of the chapel there was at one time a large heap of
stones, made up of contributions from those who came to pay their vows
there. Mr. R. M. Fergusson, in his &ldquo;<i>Rambles in the Far
North</i>,&rdquo; gives the following particulars about the
loch:&mdash;&ldquo;In olden times the diseased and infirm people of the
North Isles were wont to flock to this place and get themselves cured
by washing in its waters. Many of them walked round the shore two or
three times before entering the loch itself to perfect by so doing the
expected cure. When a person was engaged in this perambulation nothing
would induce him to utter a word, for, if he spoke, the waters of this
holy loch would lave his diseased body in vain. After the necessary
ablutions were performed they never departed without leaving behind
them some piece of cloth or bread as a gift to the presiding genius of
the place. In the beginning of the eighteenth century popular belief in
this water was as strong as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Superstitions had a vigorous life last century. Pennant, who made
his first tour in Scotland in 1769, mentions that the wells of Spey and
Drachalday, in Moray, were then much visited, coins and rags being left
at them as offerings. Nowadays holy wells are probably far from the
thoughts of persons living amid the stir and bustle of city life, but
in rural districts, where old customs linger, they are not yet
forgotten. In the country, amidst the sights and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>sounds
of nature, men are prone to cherish the beliefs and ways of their
forefathers. Practices born in days of darkness thus live on into an
era of greater enlightenment. &ldquo;The adoration of wells,&rdquo;
remarks Sir Arthur Mitchell in his &ldquo;<i>Past in the
Present</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;may be encountered in all parts of Scotland
from John o&rsquo; Groats to the Mull of Galloway,&rdquo; and he adds,
&ldquo;I have seen at least a dozen wells in Scotland which have not
ceased to be worshipped.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;the visitors are comparatively few, and those who go are
generally in earnest. They have a serious object which they desire to
attain. That object is usually the restoration to health of some poor
little child&mdash;some &lsquo;back-gane bairn.&rsquo; Indeed the cure
of sick children is a special virtue of many of these wells. Anxious
mothers make long journeys to some well of fame, and early in the
morning of the 1st of May bathe the little invalid in its waters, then
drop an offering into them by the hands of the child&mdash;usually a
pebble, but sometimes a coin&mdash;and attach a bit of the
child&rsquo;s dress to a bush or tree growing by the side of the well.
The rags we see fastened to such bushes have often manifestly been torn
from the dresses of young children. Part of a bib or little pinafore
tells the sad story of a sorrowing mother and a suffering child, and
makes the heart grieve that nothing better than a visit to one of these
wells had been found to relieve the sorrow and remove the
suffering.&rdquo; Mr. Campbell of Islay bears witness to the same fact.
In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>his &ldquo;<i>Tales of the West
Highlands</i>&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Holy healing wells are common all
over the Highlands, and people still leave offerings of pins and nails
and bits of rag, though few would confess it. There is a well in Islay
where I myself have, after drinking, deposited copper caps amongst a
hoard of pins and buttons and similar gear placed in chinks in the
rocks and trees at the edge of the &lsquo;Witches&rsquo;
well.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A striking testimony to the persistence of faith in such wells is
borne by Mr. J. R. Walker in volume v. (new series) of the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; where he describes an incident that he himself
witnessed about ten years ago on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Mr. Walker
writes, &ldquo;While walking in the Queen&rsquo;s Park about sunset, I
casually passed St. Anthony&rsquo;s Well, and had my attention
attracted by the number of people about it, all simply quenching their
thirst, some probably with a dim idea that they would reap some benefit
from the draught. Standing a little apart, however, and evidently
patiently waiting a favourable moment to present itself for their
purpose, was a group of four. Feeling somewhat curious as to their
intention I quietly kept myself in the background, and by-and-by was
rewarded. The crowd departed and the group came forward, consisting of
two old women<span class="corr" id="xd26e823" title=
"Not in source">,</span> a younger woman of about thirty, and a pale
sickly-looking girl&mdash;a child three or four years old. Producing
cups from their pockets, the old women dipped them in the pool, filled
them, and drank the contents. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>A full cup was then presented to the
younger woman and another to the child. Then one of the old women
produced a long linen bandage, dipped it in the water, wrung it, dipped
it in again, and then wound it round the child&rsquo;s head, covering
the eyes, the youngest woman, evidently the mother of the child,
carefully observing the operation and weeping gently all the time. The
other old woman not engaged in this work was carefully filling a clear
glass bottle with the water, evidently for future use. Then, after the
principal operators had looked at each other with an earnest and half
solemn sort of look, the party wended its way carefully down the
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agricultural improvements, particularly within the present century,
have done much to abolish the adoration of wells. In many cases ancient
springs have ceased to exist through draining operations. In the parish
of Urquhart, Elginshire, a priory was founded in 1125. Towards the end
of last century the site was converted into an arable field. The name
of Abbey Well, given to the spring whence the monks drew water, long
kept alive the memory of the priory; but in recent times the well
itself was filled up. St. Mary&rsquo;s Well, at Whitekirk, in
Haddingtonshire, has also ceased to be, its water having been drained
off. Near Drumakill, in Drymen parish, Dumbartonshire, there was a
famous spring dedicated to St. Vildrin. Close to it was a cross two
feet and a half in height, with the figure of the saint incised on it.
About thirty years ago, however, the relic was broken up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>and used
in the construction of a farmhouse, and not long after, the well itself
was drained into an adjoining stream. In the middle ages the spring at
Restalrig, near Edinburgh, dedicated to St. Margaret, the wife of
Malcolm Canmore, was a great attraction to pilgrims. The history of the
well is interesting. There is reason to believe that it was originally
sacred to the Holy Rood; and tradition connects it with the fountain
that gushed out at the spot where a certain hart suddenly vanished from
the sight of King David I. Mr. Walker, in the volume of the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; already referred to, throws out the suggestion that
the well may have had its dedication changed in connection with the
translation of Queen Margaret&rsquo;s relics about 1251, on the
occasion of her canonization. With regard to the date of the structure
forming the covering of the well, Mr. Walker, as an architect, is
qualified to give an opinion, and from an examination of the mason
marks on it he is inclined to think that the building was erected about
the same time as the west tower of Holyrood Abbey Church, viz., about
1170. The late Sir Daniel Wilson, in his &ldquo;<i>Memorials of
Edinburgh in the Olden Time</i>,&rdquo; gives the following account of
the structure, which, however, he by mistake describes as octagonal
instead of hexagonal:&mdash;&ldquo;The building rises internally to the
height of about four and a half feet, of plain ashlar work, with a
stone ledge or seat running round seven of the sides, while the eighth
is occupied by a pointed arch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>which forms the entrance to the well.
From the centre of the water which fills the whole area of the
building, pure as in the days of the pious queen, a decorated pillar
rises to the same height as the walls, with grotesque gurgoils, from
which the water has originally been made to flow. Above this springs a
beautifully groined roof, presenting, with the ribs that rise from
corresponding corbels at each of the eight angles of the building, a
singularly rich effect when illuminated by the reflected light from the
water below. A few years since, this curious fountain stood by the side
of the ancient and little frequented cross-road leading from the
Abbeyhill to the village of Restalrig. A fine old elder tree, with its
knotted and furrowed branches, spread a luxuriant covering over its
grass-grown top, and a rustic little thatched cottage stood in front of
it, forming altogether a most attractive object of antiquarian
pilgrimage.&rdquo; The spot, however, was invaded by the North British
Railway Company, and a station was planted on the site of the elder
tree and the rustic cottage, the spring and its Gothic covering being
imbedded in the buildings. Some years later the water disappeared,
having found another channel. The structure was taken down stone by
stone and rebuilt above St. David&rsquo;s Spring, on the north slope of
Salisbury Crags, where it still stands.</p>
<p>In cases like the above, man interfered with nature and caused the
disappearance of venerated springs. But it was not always so. In the
parish of Logierait, in Perthshire, there was a spring that took the
matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>into its own hands, and withdrew from public view.
This was the spring called in Gaelic Fuaran Chad, <i>i.e.</i>,
Chad&rsquo;s Well. An annual market used to be held close by in honour
of the saint, on the 22nd August. The spring was gratified and bubbled
away merrily. The market, however, was at length discontinued. In
consequence Fuaran Chad took offence, and sent in its resignation. In
one instance, at least, the belief in the efficacy of a spring survived
the very existence of the spring itself. This was so in the case of a
healing well near Buckie, in Banffshire, filled up some years ago by
the tenant on whose farm it was situated. So great was its fame that
some women whose infants were weakly went to the spot and cleared out
the rubbish. Water again filled the old basin, and there the infants
were bathed. While being carried home they fell asleep, and the result
was in every way to the satisfaction of the mothers.</p>
<p>Certain characteristics of water specially recommended it as an
object of worship in prim&aelig;val times. Its motion and force
suggested that it had life, and hence a soul. Men therefore imagined
that by due attention to certain rites it would prove a help to them in
time of need. What may be called the anthropomorphism of fountains has
left traces on popular superstitions. The interest taken by St.
Tredwell&rsquo;s Loch in the national events has been already alluded
to, and other examples will be noticed in future chapters.</p>
<p>One point may be mentioned here, viz., the power <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>possessed by wells of removing to another place.
St. Fillan&rsquo;s Spring, at Comrie, in Perthshire, once took its rise
on the top of the hill Dunfillan, but tradition says that it quitted
its old site for the present one, at the foot of a rock, a quarter of a
mile further south. In the article on Comrie in the &ldquo;<i>Old
Statistical Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; the well is described as
&ldquo;<i>humbled</i> indeed, but not forsaken.&rdquo; A more striking
instance of flitting is mentioned by Martin as having occurred in the
Hebrides. In his account of Islay, he says, &ldquo;A mile on the
south-west side of the cave Uah Vearnag is the celebrated well
Toubir-in-Knahar, which, in the ancient language, is as much as to say,
&lsquo;the well has sailed from one place to another&rsquo;; for it is
a received tradition of the vulgar inhabitants of this isle, and the
opposite isle of Colonsay, that this well was first at Colonsay until
an impudent woman happened to wash her hands in it, and that
immediately after, the well, being thus abused, came in an instant to
Islay, where it is like to continue, and is ever since esteemed a
catholicon for diseases by the natives and adjacent islanders.&rdquo;
Perhaps the instance that puts the greatest strain on credulity is that
of the spring dedicated to St. Fergus on the hill of Knockfergan, in
Banffshire. Tradition reports that this spring came in a miraculous
manner from Italy, though how it travelled to its quiet retreat in
Scotland we do not know. There must have been some special attraction
about the well, for a market known as the Well-Market used to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>be held beside it every year. On one occasion a
fight took place about a cheese. In consequence the market was
transferred to the neighbouring village of Tomintoul, where it
continues to be held in August, under the same name.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;<i>Romances of the West of England</i>,&rdquo; the
late Mr. Robert Hunt puts in a plea for the preservation of holy wells
and other relics of antiquity, though he allows &ldquo;that it is a
very common notion amongst the peasantry that a just retribution
overtakes those who wilfully destroy monuments, such as stone circles,
crosses, wells, and the like,&rdquo; and he mentions the case of an old
man who altered a holy well at Boscaswell, in St. Just, and was drowned
the following day within sight of his house. Mr. Hunt is speaking of
Cornish wells; but the same is doubtless true of those north of the
Tweed. Springs that can fly through the air and go through certain
other wonderful performances can surely be trusted to look after
themselves.</p>
<p>In hot Eastern lands, fountains were held in special reverence. This
was to be expected, as their cooling waters were there doubly welcome.
In accounting for the presence of the cult in the temperate zones of
Europe, we do not need to trace it to the East as Lady Wilde does in
her &ldquo;<i>Ancient Legends of Ireland</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;It could
not have originated,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;in a humid country
&hellip; where wells can be found at every step, and sky and land are
ever heavy and saturated with moisture. It must have come from an
Eastern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>people, wanderers in a dry and thirsty land, where
the discovery of a well seemed like the interposition of an angel in
man&rsquo;s behalf.&rdquo; In our own land there are no districts where
well-worship has held its ground so firmly as those occupied by peoples
of Celtic blood, such as Cornwall, Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and
the Scottish Highlands. A curious instance of the survival of
water-worship among our Scottish peasantry was seen in the custom of
going at a very early hour on New-Year&rsquo;s morning to get a pailful
of water from a neighbouring spring. The maidens of the farm had a
friendly rivalry as to priority. Whoever secured the first pailful was
said to get <i>the flower</i> of the well, otherwise known as the
<i>ream</i> or <i>cream</i> of the well. On their way to the spring the
maidens commonly chanted the couplet&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The <i>flower o&rsquo; the well</i> to our house
gaes,</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll the bonniest lad
get.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This referred to the belief that to be first at the
well was a good omen of the maiden&rsquo;s matrimonial future. It is a
far cry from archaic water-worship to this New-Year&rsquo;s love charm,
but we can traverse in thought the road that lies between. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We come next to ask how water became holy in the
folklore sense of the word. Fortunately we get a glimpse of springs at
the very time when they passed from pagan to Christian auspices. The
change made certain differences, but did not take away their miraculous
powers. We get this glimpse in the pages of Adamnan, St.
Columba&rsquo;s biographer, who narrates an incident in connection with
the saint&rsquo;s missionary work among the Picts in the latter half of
the sixth century. Adamnan tells us of a certain fountain &ldquo;famous
among the heathen people, which the foolish men, having their senses
blinded by the devil, worshipped as God. For those, who drank of this
fountain, or purposely washed their hands or feet in it, were allowed
by God to be struck by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>demoniacal art, and went home either leprous
or purblind, or at least suffering from weakness or other kind of
infirmity. By all these things the pagans were seduced and paid divine
honour to the fountain.&rdquo; Columba made use of the popular belief
in the interests of the new faith, and blessed the fountain in the name
of Christ in order to expel the demons. He then took a draught of the
water and washed his hands and feet in it, to show that it could no
longer do harm. According to Adamnan the demons deserted the fountain,
and many cures were afterwards wrought by it. In Ireland more than a
century earlier, St. Patrick visited the fountain of Findmaige, called
Slan. Offerings were wont to be made to it, and it was worshipped as a
god by the Magi of the district.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine exactly from what standpoint our pagan
ancestors regarded wells. The nature-spirits inhabiting them, styled
<i>demons</i> by Adamnan, were malignant in disposition, if we judge by
the case he mentions; but we must not therefore conclude that they were
so in every instance. Perhaps it is safe to infer that most of them
were considered favourable to man, or the reverse, according as they
were or were not propitiated by him. Even in modern times, some springs
have been regarded as hurtful. The well of St. Chad, at Lichfield, for
instance, causes ague to anyone drinking its water. Even its connection
with the saint has not removed its hurtful qualities. In west Highland
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>Folk-Tales allusion is made to poison wells, and
such are even yet regarded with a certain amount of fear. In the
article on the parish of Kilsyth in the &ldquo;<i>Old Statistical
Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; it is stated that Kittyfrist Well,
beside the road leading over the hill to Stirling, was believed to be
noxious. Successive wayfarers, when tired and heated by their climb up
hill, may have drunk injudiciously of the cold water, and thus the
superstition may have originated.</p>
<p>Stone circles have given rise to much discussion. They are perhaps
best known by their popular name of Druidical temples. Whatever were
the other purposes served by them, there is hardly any doubt that they
were primarily associated with interments. Dr. Joseph Anderson has
pointed out that a certain arch&aelig;ological succession can be
traced. Thus we find first, burial cairns <i>minus</i> stones round
them, then cairns <i>plus</i> stones, and finally, stones <i>minus</i>
cairns. At one time there was a widely-spread belief that men could be
transformed into standing stones by the aid of magic. This power was
attributed to the Druids. There are also traditions of saints thus
settling their heathen opponents. When speaking of the island of Lewis,
Martin says, &ldquo;Several other stones are to be seen here in remote
places, and some of them standing on one end. Some of the ignorant
vulgar say that they were men by enchantment turned into stones. Such
monoliths are still known to the Gaelic-speaking inhabitants of Lewis
as Fir Chreig, <i>i.e.</i>, false men. We learn from the &ldquo;<i>New
Statistical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>Account of Scotland</i>&rdquo; that the two
standing stones at West Skeld, in Shetland, were believed by the
islanders to have been originally wizards or giants. Close to the
roadside on Maughold Head, in the Isle of Man, stands an ancient runic
cross. A local tradition states that the cross was once an old woman,
who, when carrying a bundle of wool, cursed the wind for hindering her
on her journey, and was petrified in consequence.</p>
<p>With superstitions thus clinging to standing-stones it is not to be
wondered that springs in their neighbourhood should have been regarded
with special reverence. In the &ldquo;<i>Old Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; allusion is made to Tobir-Chalaich, <i>i.e.</i>,
Old Wife&rsquo;s Well, situated near a stone circle in the parish of
Keith, Banffshire, and to another well not far from a second circle in
the same parish. The latter spring ceased to be visited about the
middle of last century. Till then offerings were left at it by persons
seeking its aid. The writer of the article on the island of Barry,
Inverness-shire, in the same work, says, &ldquo;Here, <i>i.e.</i>, at
Castle-Bay, there are several Druidical temples. Near one of these is a
well which must have been once famous for its medicinal quality, as
also for curing and preventing the effects of fascination. It is called
Tobbar-nam-buadh or the Well of Virtues.&rdquo; Under the heading
&ldquo;Beltane,&rdquo; in &ldquo;<i>Jamieson&rsquo;s Scottish
Dictionary</i>,&rdquo; the following occurs:&mdash;&ldquo;A town in
Perthshire, on the borders of the Highlands, is called Tillie (or
Tullie) Beltane, <i>i.e.</i>, the eminence or rising ground
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>of the fire of Baal. In the neighbourhood is a
Druidical temple of eight upright stones, where it is supposed the fire
was kindled. At some distance from this, is another temple of the same
kind, but smaller, and near it a well still held in great veneration.
On Beltane morning, superstitious people go to this well and drink of
it, then they make a procession round it, as I am informed, nine times;
after this, they in like manner go round the temple.&rdquo; Gallstack
Well, at Drumlanrig, in Dumfriesshire, is near a group of standing
stones. From examples like the above, we may infer that some mysterious
connection was supposed to exist between standing stones and their
adjacent wells. In the Tullie Beltane instance indeed, stones and well
were associated together in the same superstitious rite.</p>
<p>A striking instance of Christianity borrowing from paganism is to be
seen in the reverence paid to the well of Innis Maree, in Loch Maree,
in Ross-shire. This well has been famous from an unknown past. It is
dedicated to St. Maelrubha, after whom both loch and island are named.
Maelrubha belonged to the monastery of Bangor, in Ireland. In the year
673, at the age of thirty-one, he settled at Applecrossan, now
Applecross, in Ross-shire, and there founded a church as the nucleus of
a conventual establishment. Over this monastery he presided for
fifty-one years, and died a natural death in 722. A legend,
disregarding historical probabilities, relates that he was slain by a
band of pagan Norse rovers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>and that his body was left in the
forest to be devoured by wild beasts. His grave is still pointed out in
Applecross churchyard, the spot being marked by a pillar slab with an
antique cross carved on it. For centuries after his death he was
regarded as the patron saint, not only of Applecross, but of a wide
district around. Pennant, who visited Innis Maree in 1772, thus
describes its appearance: &ldquo;The shores are neat and gravelly; the
whole surface covered thickly with a beautiful grove of oak, ash,
willow, wicken, birch, fir, hazel, and enormous hollies. In the midst
is a circular dike of stones, with a regular narrow entrance, the inner
part has been used for ages as a burial-place, and is still in use. I
suspect the dyke to have been originally Druidical, and that the
ancient superstition of Paganism had been taken up by the saint, as the
readiest method of making a conquest over the minds of the inhabitants.
A stump of a tree is shown as an altar, probably the memorial of one of
stone; but the curiosity of the place is the well of the saint; of
power unspeakable in cases of lunacy.&rdquo; Whatever Pennant meant by
Druidical, there is reason to believe that the spot was the scene of
pre-Christian rites. In the popular imagination the outlines of
Maelrubha&rsquo;s character seem to have become mixed up with those of
the heathen divinity worshipped in the district. Two circumstances
point to this. Firstly, as Sir Arthur Mitchell remarks in the fourth
volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>Antiquaries of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
people of the place speak often of the God Mourie instead of St.
Mourie, which may have resulted from his having supplanted the old
god.&rdquo; Secondly, as the same writer shows, by reference to old
kirk session records, it was customary in the parish to sacrifice a
bull to St. Mourie. This was done on the saint&rsquo;s day, the 25th of
August. The practice was still in existence in the latter half of the
17th century, and was then denounced as idolatrous.</p>
<p>We thus see that the sacredness of springs can be traced back
through Christianity to paganism, though there is no doubt that in some
instances it took its rise from association with early saints. In
deciding the question of origin, however, care must be taken, for, as
already indicated, the reverence anciently paid to wells led to their
selection by the early missionaries. The holy wells throughout the land
keep alive their names. An excellent example of a saint&rsquo;s
influence on a particular district is met with in the case of St.
Angus, at Balquhidder, in Perthshire. In his &ldquo;Notes in
Balquhidder&rdquo; in the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; vol. ix. (new series), Mr. J.
Mackintosh Gow remarks, &ldquo;Saint Angus, the patron saint of the
district, is said to have come to the glen from the eastward, and to
have been so much struck with its marvellous beauty that he blessed it.
The remains of the stone on which he sat to rest are still visible in
the gable of one of the farm buildings <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>at Easter Auchleskine,
and the turn of the road is yet called &lsquo;Beannachadh
Aonghais&rsquo; (Angus&rsquo;s blessing). At this spot it was the
custom in the old days for people going westward to show their respect
for the saint by repeating, &lsquo;Beannaich Aonghais ann san
Aoraidh&rsquo; (Bless Angus in the oratory or chapel), at the same time
reverently taking off their bonnets. The saint, going west, had settled
at a spot below the present kirk, and near to a stone circle, the
remains of which, and of the oratory, persons now living remember to
have seen.&rdquo; After alluding to another stone circle in a haugh
below the parish church manse, Mr. Gow mentions that this haugh is the
stance of the old market of Balquhidder, long a popular one in the
district. It was held on the saint&rsquo;s day in April and named
Feill-Aonghais, after him. In the immediate neighbourhood there is a
knoll called &ldquo;Tom Aonghais,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Angus&rsquo;s
hillock. In the grounds of Edinchip there is a curing well called in
Gaelic, &ldquo;Fuaran n&rsquo;druibh chasad,&rdquo; i.e., the
Whooping-cough Well, beside the burn &ldquo;Alt cean dhroma.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is formed of a water-worn pot hole in the limestone rock
which forms the bed of the burn, and is ten or twelve inches in
diameter at the top and six inches deep. There must be a spring running
into the hollow through a fissure, as no sooner is it emptied than it
immediately refills, and contains about two quarts of water. The well
can easily be distinguished by the large moss-covered boulder,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>round and flat, like a crushed ball, and about
seven feet in diameter, which overshadows it, and a young ash tree of
several stems growing by its side.&rdquo; This well was famous for the
cure of whooping-cough, and children were brought to it till within
recent years. The water was given in a spoon made from the horn of a
living cow. When the patients could not visit the spring in person, a
bottleful of the healing liquid was taken to their homes, and there
administered. The district round the lower waters of Loch Awe, now
comprising the united parishes of Glenorchy and Inishail was held to be
under the patronage of Connan. There is a well at Dalmally dedicated to
him. According to a local tradition he dwelt beside the well and
blessed its water.</p>
<p>In addition to springs named after particular saints, there are some
bearing the general appellation of Saints&rsquo; Wells or Holy Wells.
There are Holy Rood and Holy Wood Wells, also Holy Trinity and Chapel
Wells. There are likewise Priors&rsquo;, Monks&rsquo;,
Cardinals&rsquo;, Bishops&rsquo;, Priests&rsquo;, Abbots&rsquo;, and
Friars&rsquo; Wells. Various springs have names pointing to no
ecclesiastical connection whatever. To this class belong those known as
Virtue Wells, and those others named from the various diseases to be
cured by them. On the Rutherford estate, in the parish of West Linton,
Peeblesshire, there is a mineral spring called Heaven-aqua Well.
Considering the name, one might form great expectations as to its
virtues. There is much force in the remarks of Dr. J. Hill Burton, in
his &ldquo;<i>Book Hunter</i>.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>He says, &ldquo;The
unnoticeable smallness of many of these consecrated wells makes their
very reminiscence and still semi-sacred character all the more
remarkable. The stranger in Ireland, or the Highlands of Scotland,
hears rumours of a distinguished well, miles on miles off. He thinks he
will find an ancient edifice over it, or some other conspicuous
adjunct. Nothing of the kind. He has been lured all that distance, over
rock and bog, to see a tiny spring bubbling out of the rock, such as he
may see hundreds of in a tolerable walk any day. Yet, if he search in
old topographical authorities, he will find that the little well has
ever been an important feature of the district; that century after
century it has been unforgotten; and, with diligence he may perhaps
trace it to some incident in the life of the saint, dead more than 1200
years ago, whose name it bears.&rdquo; There are a few wells with a
more or less ornamental stone covering, such as St. Margaret&rsquo;s
Well, in the Queen&rsquo;s Park, Edinburgh, and St. Michael&rsquo;s
Well, at Linlithgow. St. Ninian&rsquo;s Well, at Stirling, and also at
Kilninian, in Mull; St. Ashig&rsquo;s Well, in Skye; St. Peter&rsquo;s
Well, at Houston, in Renfrewshire; Holy Rood Well, at Stenton, in
Haddingtonshire; and the Well of Spa, at Aberdeen, also belong to this
class.</p>
<p>As already indicated, standing stones and the wells near them were
associated together in the same ritual act. A curious parallelism can
be traced between this practice and one connected with Christian places
of worship. Near the Butt of Lewis are the ruins of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>chapel
anciently dedicated to St. Mulvay, and known in the district as
<span class="corr" id="xd26e987" title=
"Source: Teampull-mor">Teampull-m&ograve;r</span>. The spot was till
quite lately the scene of rites connected with the cure of insanity.
The patient was made to walk seven times round the ruins, and was then
sprinkled with water from St. Ronan&rsquo;s Well hard by. In Orkney it
was believed that invalids would recover health by walking round the
Cross-kirk of Wasbister and the adjoining loch in silence before
sunrise. In some instances sacred sites were walked round without
reference to wells, and, in others, wells without reference to sacred
sites. But when the two were neighbours they were often included in the
same ceremony. In the early days when Christianity was preached, the
structures of the new faith were occasionally planted close to groups
of standing stones, and it may be assumed that in some instances, at
least, the latter served to supply materials for building the former.
Even in our own day it is not uncommon for Highlanders to speak of
going to the clachan, <i>i.e.</i>, the stones, to indicate that they
are going to church. The reverence paid to the pagan sites was thus
transferred to the Christian, and any fountain in the vicinity received
a large share of such reverence.</p>
<p>In former times, both south and north of the Tweed, churches and
churchyards were regarded with special veneration as affording an
asylum to offenders against the law. In England the Right of Sanctuary
was held in great respect during Anglo-Saxon times, and after the
Norman Conquest laws were passed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>regulating the privileges of
such shelters. When a robber or murderer was pursued, he was free from
capture if he could reach the sacred precincts. But he had to enter
unarmed. His stay there was only temporary. After going through certain
formalities he was allowed to travel, cross in hand, to some
neighbouring seaport to quit his country for ever. In the reign of
Henry VIII., however, a statute was passed forbidding criminals thus to
leave their native land on the ground that they would disclose state
secrets, and teach archery to the enemies of the realm. In the north of
England, Durham and Beverley contained noted sanctuaries. In various
churches there was a stone seat called the Freedstoll or Stool of
Peace, on which the criminal, when seated, was absolutely safe. Such a
seat, dating from the Norman period, is still to be seen in the Priory
Church at Hexham, where the sanctuary was in great request by fugitives
from the debatable land between England and Scotland. The only other
Freedstoll still to be found in England is in Beverley Minster. The
Right of Sanctuary was formally abolished in England in the reign of
James I., but did not cease to be respected till much later. Such being
the regard in the middle ages for churches and their burying-grounds,
it is easy to understand why fountains in their immediate neighbourhood
were also reverenced. Several sanctuaries north of the Tweed were
specially famous. In his &ldquo;<i>Scotland in the Middle
Ages</i>,&rdquo; Professor Cosmo Innes remarks, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>&ldquo;Though all were equally sacred by the
canon, it would seem that the superior sanctity of some churches, from
the relics presented there, or the reverence of their patron saints,
afforded a surer asylum, and thus attracted fugitives to their shrines
rather than to the altars of common parish churches.&rdquo; The
churches of Stow, Innerleithen, and Tyningham were asylums at one time
specially favoured. The church on St. Charmaig&rsquo;s Island, in the
Sound of Jura&mdash;styled also <i>Eilean M&ograve;r</i> or the
<i>Great Island</i>&mdash;was formerly a noted place of refuge among
the Inner Hebrides. So much sanctity attached to the church of
Applecross that the privileged ground around it extended six miles in
every direction. In connection with his visit to Arran, Martin thus
describes what had once been a sanctuary in that island: &ldquo;There
is an eminence of about a thousand paces in compass on the sea-coast in
Druim-cruey village, and it is fenced about with a stone wall; of old
it was a sanctuary, and whatever number of men or cattle could get
within it were secured from the assaults of their enemies, the place
being privileged by universal consent.&rdquo; The enclosure was
probably an ancient burying-ground.</p>
<p>The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, otherwise known as the Knights
of Rhodes, and also as the Hospitallers, received recognition in
Scotland as an Order about the middle of the twelfth century. They had
possessions in almost every county, but their chief seat was at
Torphichen, in Linlithgowshire, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37"
href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>where the ruins of their
preceptory can still be seen. This preceptory formed the heart of the
famous sanctuary of Torphichen. In the graveyard stands a stone,
resembling an ordinary milestone with a Maltese cross carved on its
top. All the ground enclosed in a circle, having a radius of one mile
from this stone, formed a sanctuary for criminals and debtors. Other
four stones placed at the cardinal points showed the limits of the
sanctuary on their respective sides. At some distance to the east of
the preceptory is St. John&rsquo;s Well, &ldquo;to which,&rdquo; the
writer of the article in the &ldquo;<i>New Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; says, &ldquo;the Knights of St. John used to go in
days of yore for a morning draught;&rdquo; and he adds, &ldquo;whether
its virtues were medicinal or of a more hallowed character tradition
can not exactly inform us, but still its waters are thought to possess
peculiar healing powers, if not still rarer qualities which operate in
various cases as a charm.&rdquo; Perhaps no Scottish sanctuary has been
more talked about than the one at Holyrood Abbey, intended originally
for law-breakers in general, but latterly for debtors only. De Quincey
found a temporary home within its precincts. Through recent
legislation, chiefly through the Debtors (Scotland) Act of 1880, the
sanctuary has been rendered unnecessary, and its privileges, though
never formally abolished, have accordingly passed away.</p>
<p>In a pass of the Ochils, near Newburgh, overlooking Strathearn, is a
block of freestone three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>and a half feet high, four and a half
feet long, and nearly four feet broad at the base. This formed the
pedestal of the celebrated cross of Macduff, and is all that remains of
that ancient monument. The shaft of the cross was destroyed at the time
of the Reformation, in the sixteenth century. In former days the spot
was held to be a privilege and liberty of girth. When anyone claiming
kinship to Macduff, Earl of Fife, within the ninth degree committed
slaughter in hot blood and took refuge at the cross, he could atone for
his crime by the payment of nine cows and a colpindach or year-old cow.
Those who could not make good their kinship were slain on the spot.
Certain ancient burial mounds, at one time to be seen in the immediate
neighbourhood, were popularly believed to be the graves of those who
thus met their death, and a local superstition asserted that their
shrieks could be heard by night. A fountain, known as the Nine Wells,
gushes out not far from the site of the cross, and in it tradition says
that the manslayer who was entitled to claim the privilege of sanctuary
washed his hands, thereby freeing himself from the stain of blood.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The annals of hagiology are full of the connection
between saints and springs. On one occasion a child was brought to
Columba for baptism, but there was no water at hand for the performance
of the rite. The saint knelt in prayer opposite a neighbouring rock,
and rising, blessed the face of the rock. Water immediately gushed
forth, and with it the child was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"
href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>baptised. Adamnan, who tells the
story, says that the child was Lugucencalad, whose parents were from
Artdaib-muirchol (Ardnamurchan), where there is seen even to this day a
well called by the name of St. Columba. There are many wells in
Scotland named after him. As might be expected, one of these is in
Iona. Almost all are along the west coast and in the Hebrides. The name
of Kirkcolm, in Wigtownshire, signifies the Church of Columba. The
parish contains a fountain dedicated to him, known as Corswell or
Crosswell, from which the castle headland and lighthouse of Corsewall
have derived their name. A certain amount of sanctity still clings to
the fountain. Macaulay, in his &ldquo;<i>History of St.
Kilda</i>&rdquo; published in 1764, describes a spring there called by
the inhabitants Toberi-Clerich, the cleric in question being, according
to him, Columba. &ldquo;This well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is below the
village, &hellip; and gushes out like a torrent from the face of a
rock. At every full tide the sea overflows it, but how soon that ebbs
away, nothing can be fresher or sweeter than the water. It was natural
enough for the St. Kildians to imagine that so extraordinary a
phenomenon must have been the effect of some supernatural cause, and
one of their teachers would have probably assured them that Columba,
the great saint of their island and a mighty worker of miracles, had
destroyed the influence which, according to the established laws of
nature, the sea should have had on that water.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>This
spring resembles one in the parish of Tain, in Ross-shire, known as St.
Mary&rsquo;s Well. The latter is covered several hours each day by the
sea, but when the tide retires its fresh, sweet water gushes forth
again.</p>
<p>According to an old tradition, Drostan, a nephew of Columba,
accompanied the latter when on a journey from Iona to Deer in Buchan,
about the year 580, and was the first abbot of the monastery
established there. The name of the place, according to the
&ldquo;<i>Book of Deer</i>,&rdquo; was derived from the tears (in
Gaelic, der or deur, a tear), shed by Drostan on the departure of his
uncle. In reality, the name comes from the Gaelic dair, signifying an
oak. There are five springs dedicated to Drostan. They are all in the
east country, between Edzell and New Aberdour. At the latter place his
relics were preserved, and miracles of healing were wrought at his
tomb. The spring near Invermark Castle is popularly known as
Droustie&rsquo;s Well. A market, called St. Drostan&rsquo;s Fair, is
still held annually at Old Deer in December. Insch, in Aberdeenshire,
has also a St. Drostan&rsquo;s Fair. Drostan was reverenced in
Caithness, where he was tutelar saint of the parishes of Halkirk and
Canisbay. In &ldquo;<i>The Early Scottish Church</i>&rdquo; the Rev.
Dr. M&rsquo;Lauchlan mentions that Urquhart in Inverness-shire, was
called Urchudain, Maith Dhrostan, <i>i.e.</i>, St. Drostan&rsquo;s
Urquhart.</p>
<p>Adamnan, Columba&rsquo;s biographer, became abbot of Iona in 679,
and died there in 704. There are wells <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>to him at Dull, in
Perthshire, and at Forglen in Banffshire. His name occurs in Scottish
topography, but shortened, and under various disguises. In the form of
St. Oyne he has a well in Rathen parish, Aberdeenshire, where there is
a mound&mdash;probably an ancient fortified site&mdash;also called St.
Oyne&rsquo;s. About six miles north-east of Kingussie, in
Inverness-shire, is the church of the <i>quoad sacra</i> parish of
Inch, on a knoll projecting into the loch of the same name. The knoll
is called Tom Eunan, <i>i.e.</i>, the hill of Adamnan, to whom the
church was dedicated. Within the building is still to be seen a fine
specimen of the four-cornered bronze bell used in the early Celtic
church. According to a local tradition it was once carried off, but
kept calling out, &ldquo;Tom Eunan! Tom Eunan!&rdquo; till brought back
to its home. We find that Adamnan and Columba were associated together
in the district. An annual gathering, at one time held there in honour
of the latter, was named Feil Columcille, <i>i.e.</i>, Columba&rsquo;s
Fair, and was much resorted to. Women usually appeared on the occasion
in white dresses in token of baptism. An old woman, who died in 1882,
at the age of ninety, was in the habit of showing the white dress worn
by her in her young days at the fair. It finally served her as a
shroud. Adamnan visited the Northumbrian court when Egfrid was king.
His errand was one of peace-making; for he went to procure the release
of certain Irish captives who had been made prisoners by Egfrid,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>During his stay in Northumbria he became a convert
to the Roman view as against the Celtic in the two burning questions of
that age, viz., the time for holding Easter, and the nature of the
tonsure. Though he did not get his friends in Scotland to see eye to
eye with him on these points, he seems to have been generally popular
north of the Tweed. Eight churches at least were dedicated to him,
mainly in the east country between Forvie, in Aberdeenshire, and
Dalmeny, in West Lothian. One of these dedications was at Aboyne.
Skeulan Well there contains Adamnan&rsquo;s name in a corrupted
form.</p>
<p>Kieran, belonging like Columba to the sixth century, was also like
him from Ireland. He selected a cave some four miles from Campbeltown
as his dwelling-place, and there led the life of an ascetic. He died in
543 in his thirty-fourth year. Pennant thus describes the
cave:&mdash;&ldquo;It is in the form of a cross, with three fine Gothic
porticoes for entrances, &hellip; had formerly a wall at the entrance,
a second about the middle, and a third far up, forming different
apartments. On the floor is the capital of a cross and a round basin
cut out of the rock, full of fine water, the beverage of the saint in
old times, and of sailors in the present, who often land to dress their
victuals beneath this shelter.&rdquo; This basin is more minutely
described by Captain T. P. White in his &ldquo;<i>Arch&aelig;ological
Sketches in Scotland</i>.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;There is a small
basin, nearly oval in shape, neatly scooped out of a block, two feet
long by one and a half <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>wide, which exactly underlies a drip of water
from the roof of the cave. The water supply is said never to have
failed and always to keep the little basin full. Tradition calls it the
saint&rsquo;s font or holy well.&rdquo; Kieran is commemorated in
Kinloch-Kilkerran, the ancient name of the parish of Campbeltown. The
word means literally the head of the loch of Kieran&rsquo;s cell. On
one occasion Kieran dropped his book of the Gospels into a lake.
Sometime after it was recovered in an uninjured state through the
instrumentality of a cow. The cow went into the water to cool itself,
and brought out the volume attached to its hoof. Another bovine
association is connected with the building of St. Kieran&rsquo;s Church
on a hill at Errigall-keroge, in County Tyrone, Ireland. The saint had
an ox which, during the day, drew the materials for the building, and
in the evening was slaughtered to feed the workmen. The bones were
thrown each evening into a well at the foot of the hill, and, morning
by morning, the accommodating animal appeared ready for the day&rsquo;s
work. The well is still held to be miraculous. There is a spring
dedicated to Kieran at Drumlithie, in Glenbervie parish,
Kincardineshire, and another at Stonehaven, in the same county. There
is one in Troqueer parish, Kirkcudbrightshire, locally known as St.
Jergon&rsquo;s or St. Querdon&rsquo;s Well, these names being simply an
altered form of Kieran.</p>
<p>Bridget or Bride, an Irish saint, was popular in Scotland. She
received baptism from Patrick, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>died in 525 after a life of
great sanctity. She was celebrated as a worker of miracles. She made a
cow supply an enormous quantity of milk to satisfy the wants of three
thirsty bishops who came to visit her. She also cured diseases. On one
occasion two men suffering from leprosy came to her to be healed. She
made the sign of the cross over water, and told them to wash in it. One
of the two did so and was instantly restored to health; but, refusing
to help the other, he at once became leprous again, while his companion
was as suddenly made whole. On another occasion she used the sign of
the cross to stay a company bent on the capture of a maiden who had
sought refuge in the saint&rsquo;s nunnery. Perhaps her most wonderful
miracle was the hanging of her gown on a sunbeam, a somewhat unusual
cloak-peg, and one that, from the nature of the case, had not to be
sought in a dark press. Her principal monastery was at Kildare, so
named after the oak (dair) under whose shade her cell was built.
Adjoining St. Bride&rsquo;s Churchyard in London is a spring dedicated
to the saint, and popularly styled Bride&rsquo;s Well. The palace built
in the immediate neighbourhood went by the name of Bridewell. It was
handed over by Edward VI. to the city of London as a workhouse and
place of correction. At a later date the name became associated with
other houses used for a similar purpose. &ldquo;Hence it has
arisen,&rdquo; remarks Chambers in his &ldquo;<i>Book of
Days</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;that the pure and innocent Bridget, the first
of Irish nuns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>is now inextricably connected in our ordinary
national parlance with a class of beings of the most opposite
description.&rdquo; There are fully a dozen wells in Scotland bearing
her name. These are chiefly to be found in the counties of Wigtown,
Dumfries, Peebles, Lanark, Renfrew, Dumbarton, Perth, Fife, and
Aberdeen. A monastery was founded in Bridget&rsquo;s honour at
Abernethy, in Perthshire, probably in the eighth century, and she had
churches on the mainland and among the Western Islands. A curious
superstition connected with Bridget has survived to the present time,
at least in one of these islands. It has to do with a certain magical
flower styled torranain, that must be plucked during the influx of the
tide, and is of virtue to protect cows from the evil eye, and to make
them give a plentiful supply of milk. The Rev. Dr. Stewart, in his
&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Twixt Ben Nevis and Glencoe</i>,&rdquo; quotes the
incantation associated with it forwarded to him by a correspondent in
Uist. The following is one of the stanzas:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e1085">&ldquo;Let me pluck thee, Torranain!</p>
<p class="line">With all thy blessedness and all thy virtue.</p>
<p class="line">The nine blessings came with the nine parts.</p>
<p class="line xd26e1085">By the virtue of the Torranain.</p>
<p class="line xd26e1085">The hand of St. Bride with me</p>
<p class="line xd26e1095">I am now to pluck thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A saint who could give efficacy to a spell was quite
the sort of person to be entrusted with the custody of springs.</p>
<p>Ninian, popularly called Ringan, devoted his life <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>mainly
to missionary work among the Picts of Galloway, although he extended
his influence as far north as the Tay. He seems to have been honoured
in Aberdeenshire, if we may judge by a fresco, representing him,
discovered about thirty years ago in the pre-Reformation Church of
Turriff, and regard was had for him as far north as the Shetland Isles.
Even the Scot abroad did not forget him. Chalmers, in his
&ldquo;<i>Caledonia</i>,&rdquo; says that, &ldquo;in the church of the
Carmelite Friars of Bruges in Flanders, the Scottish nation founded an
altar to St. Ninian, and endowed a chaplain who officiated at
it.&rdquo; A cave by the sea in the parish of Glasserton, in
Wigtownshire, was his favourite retreat. This cave was explored about
ten years ago, and several stones, marked with incised crosses, were
discovered. Ninian brought masons from France, and at Whithorn built
Candida Casa&mdash;the first stone church in Scotland. It was in course
of construction in the year 397. Ninian then heard of the death of
Martin of Tours, and to the latter the new church was dedicated. These
two saints are found side by side in the matter of church dedications.
Thus, Martin was patron of Ulbster, in Caithness: not far off was a
church to Ninian. Strathmartin, in Forfarshire, was united in 1799 to
the parish of Mains, the latter claiming Ninian as its tutelar saint.
Sinavey Spring, in Mains parish, near the site of the ancient Castle of
Fintry, is believed to represent St. Ninian&rsquo;s name in a corrupted
form. His springs are numerous, and have a wide range from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright to those of
Forfar and Kincardine. There is a well to him near Dunnottar Castle, in
the last-mentioned county. In the island of Sanda, off the Kintyre
coast, is a spring named after him. It had a considerable local
celebrity in former times. St. Ninian&rsquo;s Well in Stirling is a
familiar spot in the district. There is a well sacred to Martin in the
Aberdeenshire parish of Cairnie. Martinmas (November 11th) came long
ago into our land as a church festival. It still remains with us as a
familiar term-day.</p>
<p>An incident in Martin&rsquo;s biography has a bearing on our
subject, through the connection between the name of the festival
commemorating it and certain of our place-names. In Scotland, the
fourth of July used to be known as Martin of Bullion&rsquo;s Day, in
honour of the translation of the saint&rsquo;s body to a shrine in the
cathedral of Tours. There is some uncertainty about the origin of the
term Bullion, though, according to the likeliest etymology, it is
derived from the French bouiller, to boil, in allusion to the heat of
the weather at that time of the year. There is an old proverb that if
the deer rise up dry and lie down dry on Martin of Bullion&rsquo;s Day,
there will be a good gose-harvest, <i>i.e.</i>, an early and plentiful
one. An annual fair was appointed to be held at Selkirk and in Dyce
parish, Aberdeenshire, in connection with the festival. There are
traces of both Martin and Bullion in Scottish topography. In Perthshire
there is the parish of St. Martin&rsquo;s, containing the estate of St.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>Martin&rsquo;s Abbey. Some miles to the east is
Strathmartin in Forfarshire, already alluded to, and not far from it in
the same county we find Bullionfield in the parish of Liff and Benvie.
It is probable that these names are in some way connected together. In
Ecclesmachan parish in Linlithgowshire, there is, as far as we know, no
trace of Martin in any dedication of chapel or spring; but Bullion is
represented. There is a spring of this name issuing from the trap rocks
of the Tor Hill. It is a mineral well. The water is slightly
impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen. In former times it was much
resorted to by health-seekers, but it is now neglected.</p>
<p>Ninian consecrated a graveyard beside the Molendinar at Cathures,
now Glasgow. About a hundred years later Kentigern, otherwise Mungo,
bishop of the Strathclyde kingdom, brought to this cemetery from
Carnock the body of Fergus, an anchorite, on a cart drawn by two wild
bulls. Over the spot where Fergus was buried was built, at a later
date, the crypt of what was to have been the south transept of the
cathedral, had that portion of the structure ever been reared. The
crypt is now popularly called Blackadder&rsquo;s Aisle, though, as Dr.
Andrew MacGeorge points out in his &ldquo;<i>Old Glasgow</i>,&rdquo; it
ought to be called Fergus&rsquo; Isle. It was so named in a minute of
the kirk-session in 1648, and an inscription in long Gothic letters on
a stone in the roof of the aisle tells the same tale. Kentigern took up
his abode on the banks of the Molendinar, and gathered round him a
company <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>of monks, each dwelling in a separate hut. In the
twelfth century the spot was surrounded by a dense forest, and in 1500
the &ldquo;Arbores sancti Kentigerni&rdquo; were landmarks in the
district. Kentigern&rsquo;s Well, now in the lower church of the
cathedral, must, from the very fact of its inclusion within the
building, have been deemed sacred before the cathedral was reared.
Other examples of wells within churches are on record, though not in
Scotland. There is a spring in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, Dublin.
The cathedrals of Carlisle, Winchester, and Canterbury, and the
minsters of York and Beverley, as well as one of two English parish
churches, either now have or once had wells within their walls. The
Rev. T. F. Thiselton Dyer gives several examples in his
&ldquo;<i>Church Lore Gleanings</i>,&rdquo; and remarks, &ldquo;Such
wells may have been of special service in Border churches, which, like
the cathedral of Carlisle, served as places of refuge for the
inhabitants in case of sudden alarm or foray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides his well in the cathedral, Kentigern had another dedicated
to him at Glasgow, close to Little St. Mungo&rsquo;s Church, in the
immediate neighbourhood of the trees already mentioned. There are fully
a dozen wells sacred to him north of the Tweed. As might be expected,
these are almost all to be found in the counties south of the Forth and
Clyde, and particularly in those to the west of that district. There is
one in Kincardineshire, at Kinneff, locally known as Kenty&rsquo;s
Well. Under the name of St. Mongah&rsquo;s Well there is a spring
dedicated to him in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>Yorkshire at Copgrove Park four miles from
Boroughbridge. A bath close by, supplied with water from this spring,
was formerly much frequented by invalids of all ages, who remained
immersed for a longer or shorter time in its intensely cold water.
Other wells to Kentigern are to be met with in the north of England.
The parish of Crossthwaite in Cumberland has its church dedicated to
him. The spot was the thwaite or clearing in the wood where he set up
his cross. Thanet Well, in Greystoke parish in the same county, is
believed to have derived its name from Tanew or Thenew,
Kentigern&rsquo;s mother, familiar to the citizens of Glasgow as St.
Enoch. St. Enoch&rsquo;s Well, close to St. Enoch&rsquo;s Square in
that burgh, used to be a favourite resort of health-seekers. It has now
no existence.</p>
<p>Cuthbert, besides a well at St. Boswell&rsquo;s, in Roxburghshire,
had a bath in Strath Tay<span class="corr" id="xd26e1132" title=
"Not in source">,</span> a rock-hewn hollow full of water where he
periodically passed several hours in devotion. This famous Northumbrian
missionary was born about 635, and spent his early boyhood as a
shepherd on the southern slopes of the Lammermoors. He lived for
thirteen years as a monk in the monastery of Old Melrose, situated two
miles east from the present Melrose on a piece of land almost
surrounded by the Tweed. On the death of Boisil, Cuthbert was appointed
prior. He afterwards became bishop of Lindisfarne. During his stay at
Melrose he visited the land of the Niduarian Picts, in other words the
Picts of Galloway, and left a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>record of his journey in the name of
Kirkcudbright, <i>i.e.</i>, the Church of Cuthbert. Various other
churches were dedicated to him in the south of Scotland and in the
north of England. A well-known Edinburgh parish bears his name. He was
honoured as far south as Cornwall. St. Cuby&rsquo;s Well, locally
called St. Kilby&rsquo;s, between Duloe and Sandplace in that county is
believed to have been dedicated to him.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of uncertainty about the history of Palladius.
He is believed to have been a missionary from Rome to the Irish in the
fifth century, and to have suffered martyrdom for the faith. It is
recorded of him that on one occasion, by removing some turf in the name
of the Holy Spirit, he caused a spring to gush forth to supply water
for baptism. He is popularly associated with Kincardineshire, though
there is reason to believe that he had no personal connection with the
district. A spring in Fordoun parish is locally known as Paldy&rsquo;s
Well, and an annual market goes by the name of Paldy&rsquo;s or
Paddy&rsquo;s Fair. A chapel was dedicated to him there, and received
his relics, brought thither by his disciple Terrananus, whose name is
still preserved in Banchory-Ternan, and who seems to have belonged to
the district. Ternan has a well at Banchory-Devenick, and another at
Kirkton-of-Slains, in Buchan. The old church of Arbuthnot was dedicated
to him. It was for this church that the Missal, Psalter, and Office of
the Virgin, now in the possession of Viscount Arbuthnot, were written
and illuminated towards the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>end of the fifteenth century, these
being the only <i>complete</i> set of Service-Books of a Scottish
Church that have come down to us from pre-Reformation times.</p>
<p>Brendan of Clonfert in Ireland, visited several of the Western Isles
during the first half of the sixth century, and various churches were
afterwards dedicated to him there. He is connected also with Bute. The
name Brandanes, applied to its inhabitants, came from him, and he bids
fair to be remembered in the name of Kilbrandon Sound, between Arran
and Kintyre. He was patron of a well in the island of Barra and was
tutelar saint of Boyndie and Cullen in Banffshire; but we are not aware
that any well at either of these places was called after him.</p>
<p>A curious legend is related to account for the origin of the See of
Aberdeen. According to it Machar or Macarius, along with twelve
companions, received instructions from Columba to wander over Pictland,
and to build his cathedral-church where he found a river making a bend
like a bishop&rsquo;s staff. Such a bend was found in the Don at Old
Aberdeen. St. Machar&rsquo;s Cathedral, built beside it, keeps alive
the saint&rsquo;s memory. In the neighbouring grounds of Seton is St.
Machar&rsquo;s Well. Though now neglected, it was honoured in former
times, and its water was used at baptisms in the cathedral. Under the
name of Mocumma or Mochonna, Macarius appears as one of the followers
of Columba on his memorable voyage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>from Ireland to Iona. He is said
to have visited Pope Gregory the Great at Rome, and to have been for a
time bishop of Tours. In Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, is a well sacred to
him called Tobar-Mhachar, pronounced in the district Tobar-Vacher.</p>
<p>Constantine, known also by his other names of Cowstan, Chouslan, and
Cutchou, was a prince of Cornwall in the sixth century, and was
acquainted with Columba and Kentigern. He relinquished his throne and
crossed over to Ireland, where he turned monk. At a later date he came
to the west of Scotland, and founded a monastery at Golvedir, believed
to be Govan, near Glasgow, and, according to Fordun, became its abbot.
Kilchouslan Church, on the north side of Campbeltown Bay, Kintyre, was
built in his honour. In its graveyard there is, or was till quite
lately, a round stone about the size of a grinding stone. In the centre
is a hole large enough to let the hand pass through. There is a
tradition that if a man and woman eloped, and were able to join hands
through this hole before being overtaken by their kinsfolk they were
free from further pursuit. In the spring of 1892 an interesting find of
old coins was made in the same graveyard. These consisted of groats and
half-groats, some of English and some of Scottish coinage, the earliest
belonging to the reign of Edward II. of England. According to Martin,
the well of St. Cowstan at Garrabost, in Lewis, was believed never to
boil any kind of meat, though its water was kept over the fire for a
whole day. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>well is on a steep slope at the shore. Not far off
once stood St. Cowstan&rsquo;s Chapel, but its site is now under
tillage.</p>
<p>Serf or Servanus, who flourished during the latter half of the
seventh century, was connected with the district north of the Firth of
Forth, particularly with Culross, and the island named after him in
Loch Leven, where he founded a monastery. At Dysart, Serf had a cave,
and in it tradition says that he held a discussion with the devil. The
name of Dysart indeed, comes from this <i lang="la">desertum</i> or
retreat. Serf had a cell at Dunning, in Strathearn, where he died in
the odour of sanctity. He had also some link with the parish of
Monzievaird, where the church was dedicated to him, and where a small
loch still goes by the name of St. Serf&rsquo;s Water. There is a well
sacred to him at Alva. St. Shear&rsquo;s Well, at Dumbarton, retains
his name in an altered form. Early last century this spring was put to
a practical purpose, as arrangements were then made to lead its water
across the Leven by pipes to supply the burgh. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In any notice of early saints Ronan must not be
forgotten, especially when we remember that perhaps no spring, thanks
to Sir Walter Scott, is so familiar to the general reader as St.
Ronan&rsquo;s Well. It has been commonly identified with the mineral
well at Innerleithen, in Peeblesshire for long held in much favour in
cases of eye and skin complaints, and also for the cure of dyspepsia.
The spring is situated a short distance above the town on the skirt of
Lee Pen. The writer of the article on Innerleithen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>parish
in the &ldquo;<i>New Statistical Account of Scotland</i>&rdquo; says
that this spring &ldquo;was formerly called the &lsquo;Dow-well&rsquo;
from the circumstance that, long before the healing virtues of the
water were discovered, pigeons from the neighbouring country resorted
to it.&rdquo; The name, however, is more probably derived from the
Gaelic <i>dhu</i> or <i>dubh</i>, signifying <i>black</i>. This is all
the more likely when we remember that the ground around was wet and
miry before the spring was put into order, and the present pump-room
built, in 1826. We find marks of Ronan in Scottish topography. In
Dumbartonshire is Kilmaronock, meaning, literally, the Church of my
little Ronan; Kilmaronog near Loch Etive has the same signification.
Dr. Skene refers to these two dedications, and adds, &ldquo;Ronan
appears to have carried his mission to the Isles. He has left his trace
in Iona, where one of the harbours is Port Ronan. The church,
afterwards the parish church, was dedicated to him, and is called
Teampull Ronaig, and its burying-ground, Cladh Ronan. Then we find him
at Rona, in the Sound of Skye, and another Rona, off the coast of
Lewis; and, finally, his death is recorded in 737 as Ronan, abbot of
Cinngaradh or Kingarth, in Bute.&rdquo; Ronan is patron of various
springs. There is one sacred to him near Kilmaronock, another in the
Aberdeenshire parish of Strathdon, and another, already referred to,
beside Teampull M&ograve;r, in the Butt of Lewis. The parish of
Strowan, now joined to that of Monzievaird, has a well to the saint.
This was to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>be expected, since the name of the parish is
merely an altered form of St. Rowan or Ronan. About a hundred yards
above the bridge of Strowan, there is a deep pool in the river Earn,
called Pol-Ronan, and a piece of ground hard by was formerly the site
of the yearly gathering known as Feill-Ronan or St. Ronan&rsquo;s
Fair.</p>
<p>The parish of St. Fergus, in Buchan, known till the year 1616 as
Langley, commemorates an Irish missionary of the eighth century, who
led a roving life, if we can believe the tradition, that he evangelised
Caithness, Buchan, Strathearn, and Forfarshire, as well as attended an
Ecclesiastical Council at Rome. The legend that his well in Kirkmichael
parish, Banffshire, was at one time in Italy may be connected with his
visit to Rome. Concerning this spring, the Rev. Dr. Gregor gives the
following particulars:&mdash;&ldquo;Fergan Well is situated on the
south-east side of Knock-Fergan, a hill of considerable height on the
west side of the river Avon, opposite the manse of Kirkmichael. The
first Sunday of May and Easter Sunday were the principal Sundays for
visiting it, and many from the surrounding parishes, who were affected
with skin diseases or running sores, came to drink of its water, and to
wash in it. The hour of arrival was twelve o&rsquo;clock at night, and
the drinking of the water and the washing of the diseased part took
place before or at sunrise. A quantity of the water was carried home
for future use. Pilgrimages were made up to the end of September,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>by which time the healing virtues of the water had
become less. Such after-visits seem to have begun in later
times.&rdquo; Fergus died at Glamis, and his relics soon began to work
cures. His head was carried off to the monastery of Scone, and was so
much esteemed in later times that, by order of James IV., a silver case
was made for it. His cave and well are to be seen at Glamis. There is a
spring dedicated to him near Montrose, and there is another at
Wick.</p>
<p>Various other saintly personages have left traces of their names in
holy wells. Chalmers, in his &ldquo;<i>Caledonia</i>,&rdquo; mentions
that the ancient church of Aldcamus, in Cockburnspath parish,
Berwickshire, was dedicated to Helen, mother of Constantine, and that
its ruins were known as St. Helen&rsquo;s Kirk. A portion of the
building still stands. To the north of it is a burying-ground; but,
curiously enough, as Mr. Muir points out in his &ldquo;<i>Ancient
Churches of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; the spot does not appear ever to have
been used for purposes of sepulture. We do not know surely of any
spring to Helen in the immediate neighbourhood, but there is one at
Darnick, near Melrose. Another is in Kirkpatrick-Fleming parish,
Dumfriesshire. Perhaps the best known is St. Helen&rsquo;s Well, beside
the highway from Maybole to Ayr, about two-and-a-half miles from the
former town. It was much resorted to on May Day for the cure of sickly
children. On Timothy Pont&rsquo;s map, of date 1654, there is a
&ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s Loch&rdquo; marked a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>little to the south-west
of Camelon, in Stirlingshire. Some writers have attempted to claim
Helen as a native of Britain, and Colchester and York have, for
different reasons, been fixed on as her birth-place. The circumstance
that Constantine was proclaimed Emperor at the latter town, on the
death there of his father, Constantius Chlorus, probably gave rise to
the tradition. Anyhow, Helen seems to have been held in high honour in
England. In an article in the &ldquo;<i>Arch&aelig;ological
Journal</i>&rdquo; for December, 1891, Mr. Edward Peacock mentions that
there are at least fifteen wells named after her south of the Tweed. He
adds, &ldquo;there are many churches dedicated to the honour of St.
Helen in England, but they are very irregularly distributed. None seems
to occur in Cumberland, Westmoreland, or Essex. The rest of the English
shires, for which we have authentic information, give the following
results:&mdash;Devonshire, three; Durham, two; Kent, one; Lincolnshire,
twenty-eight; Northumberland, three; Nottinghamshire, fifteen;
Yorkshire, thirty-two.&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s name occurs in Welsh
legends; but, as Mr. Peacock observes, &ldquo;early history is so much
distorted in them, that, if we did not know of her from more authentic
sources, we might well believe Helen to have been a mere creation of
the fervid Keltic imagination.&rdquo; As far as is known there are
neither wells nor church dedications to her in the Principality.</p>
<p>At Ayton, in Berwickshire, we find St. Abb&rsquo;s Well, recalling
Abb or &AElig;bba, who, in the seventh century, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>presided
over a monastery on the headland still bearing her name, and in whose
honour the priory at Coldingham was founded by Edgar, son of Malcolm
Canmore, some four centuries and a half later. Her monastery on the
headland was founded by Aidan, who was sent from Iona to the North of
England in response to a request from King Oswald, of Bernicia, for a
missionary to preach Christianity to his pagan subjects. This was about
the year 635. Aidan made the island of Lindisfarne, off the coast of
Northumberland, his head-quarters. It is still known as Holy Island.
Aidan has not been forgotten in the matter of wells. There are four to
him, viz., at Menmuir and at Fearn, in Forfarshire; at Balmerino, in
Fife; and at Cambusnethan, in Lanarkshire. This last, called St.
Iten&rsquo;s Well, was noted for the cure of asthma and
skin-disease.</p>
<p>Boisil, abbot of the monastery of Old Melrose, about the middle of
the seventh century, still lives in the name of the Roxburghshire
village and parish of St. Boswell&rsquo;s. There is a spring in the
parish bearing the name of The Well-brae Wall. Boswell&rsquo;s own
spring is popularly styled the Hare-well. Not far from both is St.
Boswell&rsquo;s Burn, a tributary of the Tweed. The local fair held on
July 18th, in honour of the saint, used to be a notable one in the
border counties, and was frequented by large numbers of gipsies who set
up booths for the sale of their wares.</p>
<p>Bathan, who flourished in the early seventh century, had to do with
Shetland, and with the region about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>the Whittadder, in Berwickshire.
Abbey St. Bathans, in the latter county, is named after him. His well
is on one of the haughs beside the river, not far from the ruined
nunnery. Its water is believed never to freeze.</p>
<p>Boniface belonged to the same century. He is said to have preached
Christianity at Gowrie, in Pictavia, and afterwards at Rosemarkie, in
the Black Isle, where he died at the age of eighty, and was buried in
the church of St. Peter. A well and a fair at Rosemarkie still keep
alive his memory.</p>
<p>The fame of Catherine of Alexandria travelled to Scotland at a
comparatively early period. This holy maiden was noted for her
learning<span class="corr" id="xd26e1222" title="Source: ,">.</span>
Indeed she was so wise that Maxentius the Emperor called her a
&ldquo;second Plato.&rdquo; The Emperor&rsquo;s compliments, however,
stopped there, for he ordered her to be executed on account of her
contempt for paganism. The wheel, her usual attribute in art, was not
the instrument of her martyrdom, as it was miraculously destroyed. She
met her death by being beheaded, and, immediately thereafter, her body
was carried by angels to Mount Sinai. These and other legendary
incidents must have conduced to make the saint popular. St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Balm-well, at Liberton, Mid-Lothian, had a high
reputation for curing skin-disease. Martin speaks of a well to St.
Catherine on the south coast of Eigg, reckoned by the islanders a
specific in all kinds of disease. He gives the following account of its
dedication by Father Hugh, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>a priest, and of the respect paid to
the spring in consequence:&mdash;&ldquo;He (the priest) obliged all the
inhabitants to come to this well, and then employed them to bring
together a great heap of stones at the head of the spring by way of
penance. This being done, he said Mass at the well, and then
consecrated it; he gave each of the inhabitants a piece of wax candle,
which they lighted, and all of them made the Dessil,&mdash;of going
round the well sun-ways, the priest leading them; and from that time it
was accounted unlawful to boil any meat with the water of this
well.&rdquo; In the south-west of Scotland, Catherine has, or had,
three wells, viz., at Stoneykirk, at Low Drumore, and at Old Luce,
opposite the Abbey. In the north-east there are three, viz., at Fyvie,
Aberdeenshire; and in Alvah parish, Banffshire; and at Banff itself. At
Shotts, in Lanarkshire, the fountain by the roadside immediately below
the parish church is, or at least was, locally known as Cat&rsquo;s or
Kate&rsquo;s Well&mdash;a contraction of the Saint&rsquo;s
name&mdash;reminding one of the Kate Kennedy celebration at St. Andrews
University, which originated in connection with the gift of a bell by
Bishop Kennedy in honour of the saint. The ruins of Caibeal Cairine,
i.e., Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel, are in Southend parish, Kintyre, and
two farms called North and South Carine are in the immediate
neighbourhood. Captain White, when exploring the district, sought for
St. Catherine&rsquo;s Well in the adjoining glen, but failed to find
it. A chapel to the saint once stood in the <i>quondam</i> town of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>Kincardine in the Mearns. Its graveyard alone
remains. St. Catherine&rsquo;s Fair, held at Kincardine till the year
1612, was then transferred to the neighbouring Fettercairn. There is
perhaps no place-name more familiar to visitors to Inveraray than St.
Catherine&rsquo;s, on the opposite shore of Loch Fyne. It was in St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Aisle, within the parish church of Linlithgow, that
James IV. saw the mysterious <span class="corr" id="xd26e1232" title=
"Source: apparation">apparition</span> that warned him to beware of
Flodden. At Port-Erin, in the Isle of Man, is a spring close to the
beach, and on a stone beside it in old lettering, can be read the piece
of advice:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">Lawrence is represented by various springs, viz., by
one in Kirkcudbrightshire, at Fairgirth; by one in Elginshire, at New
Duffus; and by two in Aberdeenshire, at Kinnord; and at Rayne, where a
horse market, called Lawrence Fair, is still held annually in August.
Near the Fairgirth spring stand the ivy-clad ruins of St.
Lawrence&rsquo;s Chapel, at one time surrounded by a graveyard. The
parish of Slamannan, in Stirlingshire, was anciently called St.
Lawrence, its pre-Reformation church having been dedicated to him. An
excellent spring, not far from the parish church, is known as St.
Lawrence&rsquo;s Well. There is reason to believe that all these
dedications relate to Lawrence, who, about the middle of the third
century, suffered at Rome, by being broiled over a slow fire, and in
whose honour the Escurial in Spain was built <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>in the
form of a gridiron&mdash;the supposed instrument of his martyrdom.
Laurencekirk, in Kincardineshire, anciently called Conveth, received
its name, not from the martyr, but from Lawrence, archbishop of
Canterbury, successor of Augustine, early in the seventh century. He is
said to have visited the Mearns. The church of Conveth was named in his
honour Laurencekirk. As far as we know, however, there is no spring to
him in the district.</p>
<p>Margaret, queen and saint, wife of Malcolm Canmore, was a light amid
the darkness of the eleventh century. Indeed she was a light to many
later centuries. The secret of her beneficial influence lay in her
personal character, and she undoubtedly did much to recommend
civilisation to a barbarous age. At the same time it must not be
forgotten that through her English training she was unable to
appreciate either the speech or the special religious institutions of
her Scottish subjects, and that, accordingly, the changes introduced by
her were not all reforms. When sketching her influence on the history
of her time, the Rev. Dr. M&rsquo;Lauchlan, in his &ldquo;<i>Early
Scottish Church</i>,&rdquo; observes, &ldquo;She was somewhat
unwillingly hindered from entering a monastery by her marriage with
Malcolm, and the latter repaid the obligation by unbounded devotion to
her and readiness to fall in with all her schemes. She was brought up
in the Anglo-Saxon Church, as that Church was moulded by Augustine and
other emissaries of Rome, and was in consequence naturally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>opposed
to many of the peculiarities of the Scottish Church, which was still
without diocesan bishops, and had many things in its forms of worship
peculiar to itself.&rdquo; Dunfermline was Malcolm&rsquo;s favourite
place of residence, and many were the journeys made by his wife between
it and Edinburgh. The names of North and South Queensferry, where she
crossed the Forth, tell of these royal expeditions. Malcolm and
Margaret were associated with the town of Forfar. Local topography has
still its King&rsquo;s Muir, and its Queen&rsquo;s Well to testify to
the fact; and on the Inch of Forfar Loch, where Margaret had a
residence, an annual celebration was long held in her honour. She had a
spring at Edinburgh Castle, described as &ldquo;the fountain which
rises near the corner of the King&rsquo;s Garden, on the road leading
to St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s Church.&rdquo; St. Margaret&rsquo;s
Well&mdash;once at Restalrig, now in the Queen&rsquo;s Park&mdash;has
already been referred to. At Dunfermline there is a spring in a cave
where, according to tradition, she spent many an hour in pious
meditation. The cave is about seven feet in height, fully eight in
breadth, and varies in depth from eight to eleven. &ldquo;This
cave,&rdquo; remarks the Rev. Peter Chalmers in his &ldquo;<i>History
of Dunfermline</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;is situated at a short distance north
from the Tower Hill, and from the mound crossing the ravine on which
part of the town stands. There is at present a small spring well at the
bottom, the water of which rises at times and covers the whole lower
space; but anciently, it is to be presumed, there was none, or at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>least it must have been covered, and prevented
from overflowing the floor, which would either have been formed of the
rock or have been paved.&rdquo; A considerable amount of rubbish
accumulated in the cave, but this was removed in 1877. &ldquo;During
the process of clearing out the cave,&rdquo; remarks Dr. Henderson in
his &ldquo;<i>Annals of Dunfermline</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;two stone seats
or benches were discovered along the base of the north and south sides,
but there were no carvings or devices seen on them. Near the back of
the cave a small sunk well was found, but it is now covered over with a
stone flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several Scripture characters have wells named after them. St.
Matthew has springs at Kirkton, Dumfriesshire, and at Roslin,
Midlothian. St. Andrew&rsquo;s name is attached to wells at Sandal, in
Kintyre; at North Berwick, in East Lothian; at Shadar, in Lewis; and at
Selkirk&mdash;this last having been uncovered in 1892, after remaining
closed, it is believed, for fully three hundred years. A spring at St.
Andrews, called Holy Well, is understood to have been dedicated either
to Andrew or to Regulus. St. Paul has springs at Fyvie and at
Linlithgow; St. Philip is patron of one in Yarrow parish, Selkirkshire;
St. James has one at Garvock, in Aberdeenshire; St. Thomas has
three&mdash;at Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire; at Crieff, in Perthshire; and
near Stirling; and St. John has a considerable number of springs. Some
of these are to the Evangelist, and some to the Baptist. It is often
difficult to know to which of the two the patronage of a given well
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>should be ascribed. Of the four chapels along the
east wall of the <i>lower church</i> of Glasgow Cathedral, the one next
to St. Mungo&rsquo;s Well was dedicated in pre-Reformation times to St.
John the Evangelist. It would have been more appropriately dedicated to
the Baptist. St. John&rsquo;s Wells are to be found at Moffat, in
Dumfriesshire; at Logie Coldstone, in Aberdeenshire; near Fochabers, in
Elginshire; at Inverkeithing, Balmerino; and Falkland, in Fife; at
Kinnethmont, and in New Aberdour, in Aberdeenshire; at Marykirk, in
Kincardineshire; at Kirkton of Deskford, at Ordiquhill, and also near
the old church of Gamrie, in Banffshire; at Stranraer, in Wigtownshire;
at Dunrobin, in Sutherland; and elsewhere. There are more than a dozen
wells to St. Peter. These are to be found mainly in counties in the
south-west, and in the north-east. In the latter district there is a
well at Marnoch, in Banffshire, called Petrie&rsquo;s Well.</p>
<p>St<span class="corr" id="xd26e1269" title="Not in source">.</span>
Anne, the reputed mother of the Virgin, presided over wells at
Ladykirk, in Berwickshire; near the old church of St. Anne, in Dowally
parish, Perthshire; and at Glass, on the Deveron. The Virgin herself
was specially popular as the patroness of fountains. There are <i>over
seventy</i> dedicated to her under a variety of names, such as, St.
Mary&rsquo;s Well, Maria Well, &amp;c. The town of Motherwell, in
Lanarkshire, was so called after a famous well to the Virgin.
Tobermory, in Mull&mdash;literally, Well of Mary&mdash;was originally a
fountain. A village was built beside it, in 1788, as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>fishing
centre for the British Fisheries&rsquo; Company. A curious legend about
the now ivy-clad ruins of the church of St. Mary in Auchindoir parish,
Aberdeenshire, is thus referred to by Mr. A. Jervise in the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; vol. viii. (old series):&mdash;&ldquo;According to
tradition, it was originally proposed to rebuild the church at a place
called Kirkcairns (now Glencairns) to the south of Lumsden village, and
but for the warning voice of the Virgin, who appears to have been a
good judge both of locality and soil, the kirk would have been placed
in an obscure sterile district. Besides being in the neighbourhood of
good land, fine views of the upper part of Strathbogie and of the
surrounding hills are obtained from the present site&#8202;&hellip;.
St. Mary&rsquo;s Well is about a hundred yards to the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Michael the Archangel did not fold his wings over any Scottish
wells, he at least gave name to several. There is a St. Michael&rsquo;s
Spring in Kirkmichael parish, Banffshire, and another at Dallas in
Elginshire. In both cases, the ancient church was dedicated to him.
Culsalmond, in Aberdeenshire, and Applegarth, in Dumfriesshire, have,
and Edinburgh once had, a St. Michael&rsquo;s Well. The best known is
probably the one at Linlithgow, with its quaint
inscription&mdash;&ldquo;Saint Michael is kinde to straingers.&rdquo;
Mr. J. R. Walker&mdash;to whose list of Holy Wells in the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; vol. v. (new series), we have been indebted for
various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>useful hints&mdash;remarks, &ldquo;The building
covering this well dates only from 1720&#8202;&hellip;. It is
conjectured that the statue was taken from the Cross-well when restored
about that date and placed here to represent St. Michael, who is the
patron saint of Linlithgow Church&#8202;&hellip;. With the exception of
the statue, which is undoubtedly of much earlier date than 1720, the
structure shows the utter absence of architectural
knowledge&mdash;especially Gothic&mdash;characteristic of the last
century in Scotland. Michael was tutelar saint, not only of the church,
but also of the burgh of Linlithgow. In the town Arms he is represented
with outspread wings, standing on a serpent whose head he is piercing
with a spear. He was also the guardian of the burgh of Dumfries. At
Inverlussa, in North Knapdale parish, Argyllshire, may be seen the
ancient chapel and burying-ground of Kilmichael. A well in the
immediate neighbourhood is dedicated, not to the archangel, but to some
local ecclesiastic, whose name is now forgotten. In reference to this
spring, Captain White says, &ldquo;Trickling out from under a rock, is
the Priest&rsquo;s Well (Tobar-ant-Sagairt), famous, like many another
spring of so-called holy water, for its miraculous healing virtues. I
believe the country people have by no means lost their faith in its
powers.&rdquo; The extent of the archangel&rsquo;s popularity in
Scotland is shown by his impress on topography. Among place-names we
find <i>at least three</i> Kilmichaels, and there are <i>five</i>
parishes called Kirkmichael, respectively in the counties of Dumfries,
Ayr, Perth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>Ross and Cromarty, and Banff. A chapel is said to
have been dedicated to him at a very early date on the top of the
Castle Rock at Edinburgh. Another once stood in the demesne of Lovat,
where was founded, about 1232, a Priory for French monks, who were so
struck with the beauty of the spot that they called it Beau-lieu, now
Beauly. Far west, in the outer Hebrides, he had faithful votaries. On
the island of Grimisay, close to North Uist, a chapel styled Teampull
Mhicheil was built in his honour towards the close of the fourteenth
century. It was the work of Amie, otherwise Annie, wife of John of
Isla, first Lord of the Isles, and was used by her as an oratory when
prevented by rough weather from crossing the Minch to visit her friends
in Lorne. That the archangel should have had wells named after him is
therefore not surprising. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=

<p class="first">Beds and Chairs of stone are connected with various
early saints, and as such relics are often associated with holy wells,
some notice of these may not be without interest. We have already seen
that cave life was rather popular among these early missionaries.
Anything of a rocky nature was therefore quite in line with their
ascetic ways. Hoy, one of the Orkney Islands, famous for its wild
scenery, and specially for the pillar of rock popularly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>styled
The Old Man, contains a curious monument of antiquity in the shape of a
large block of sandstone called The Dwarfie Stone, hollowed out long
ago by some unknown hand. The chamber, thus excavated, contains two
beds hewn out of the stone, one of them having a pillow of the same
hard material. On the floor of the chamber is a hearth where a fire had
evidently burned, and in the roof is a hole for the escape of the
smoke. Legend reports that a giant and his wife abode within; but the
hollow space was more probably the retreat of some
hermit&mdash;perhaps, of more than one, seeing there are two couches;
though, possibly, one of the supposed couches may have been a table and
the other a bed. Perhaps the anchorite had his spring whither he
wandered daily to slake his thirst; but, as far as we know, there is no
tradition regarding any holy well in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Martin, in connection with his visit to Orkney, refers to a stone in
the chapel of Ladykirk, in South Ronaldshay, called St. Magnus&rsquo;s
Boat. The stone was four feet in length, and tapered away at both ends;
but its special feature was the print of two human feet on the upper
surface. A local tradition affirmed that when St. Magnus wanted on one
occasion to cross the Pentland Firth to Caithness he used this stone as
his boat, and that he afterwards carried it to Ladykirk. According to
another tradition, the stone served in pre-Reformation times for the
punishment of delinquents, who were obliged to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>stand
barefooted upon it by way of penance. There is a St. Magnus&rsquo;s
Well, not in South Ronaldshay, however, but at Birsay, in the mainland
of Orkney. When Conval crossed from Ireland to Scotland, in the seventh
century, he, too, made a block of stone do duty as a boat. It found a
resting-place beside the river Cart, near Renfrew, and was known as
<i>Currus Sancti Convalli</i>. By its means miraculous cures were
wrought on man and beast. A rock at the mouth of Aldham Bay, in
Haddingtonshire, is known as St. Baudron&rsquo;s Boat, and tradition
says that he crossed on it from the Bass, where he had a cell. This
saint&mdash;called also Balthere and Baldred&mdash;founded the
monastery of Tyningham, and died early in the seventh century. He must
have been popular in the district, for, if we can believe an old
legend, the parishioners of the churches of Aldham, Tyningham, and
Prestonkirk tried to get possession of his relics. To satisfy their
demands his body was miraculously multiplied by three, and each church
was thus provided with one. Near Tantallon Castle is St.
Baldred&rsquo;s Well, and a fissure in the cliff at Whitberry, not far
from the mouth of the Tyne, is known as St. Baldred&rsquo;s Bed or
Cradle.</p>
<p>Marnan or Marnoch, besides giving name to the town of Kilmarnock, in
Ayrshire, and to the Island of Inchmarnoch, off Bute, is remembered in
the name of the Banffshire parish of Marnoch, where he laboured as a
missionary in the seventh century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>His head was kept as a revered
relic in the church of Aberchirder, and solemn oaths were sworn by it.
Use was also made of it for therapeutic purposes. It was periodically
washed, and the water was given to the sick for the restoration of
their health. This was not an isolated case. Bede tells us, that after
Cuthbert&rsquo;s death, some of the water in which his body was washed,
was given to an epileptic boy along with some consecrated earth, and
brought about a cure. A stone, called St. Marnan&rsquo;s Chair, is, or
was till lately, to be seen at Aberchirder; and a spring, near the
parish manse, bears the saint&rsquo;s name. About a mile and a half
from the church of Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire, is St. Muchricha&rsquo;s
Well, and beside it is a stone marked with a cross. At one time, this
stone was removed. According to a local tradition, it was brought back
by Muchricha, the guardian of the well, who seemed unwilling to lose
sight of the lost property. In the parish of Kildonan, Sutherland, two
or three blocks of stone, placed in the form of a seat, went by the
name of Cathair Donan, <i>i.e.</i>, Donan&rsquo;s Chair. In his
<i>cille</i> or church, Donan taught the truths of Christianity; and,
seated in his <i>cathair</i>, he administered justice to the people of
the district. There is a St. Donan&rsquo;s Well in Eigg, the island
where the saint and his companion clerics were murdered by the natives
early in the seventh century.</p>
<p>Patrick, the well-known missionary of Ireland, was reverenced also
in Scotland. There is a well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>dedicated to him in the parish of
Muthill, Perthshire, and close to it once stood a chapel, believed to
have borne his name. From the article on Muthill parish, in the
&ldquo;<i>New Statistical Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; we learn that
in former times the inhabitants of the district held the saint&rsquo;s
memory &ldquo;in such veneration that, on his day, neither the clap of
the mill was heard nor the plough seen to move in the furrow.&rdquo;
There is a well dedicated to him in Dalziel parish, Lanarkshire. About
sixty yards from St. Patrick&rsquo;s temple, in the island of Tyree, is
a rock, with a hollow on the top, two feet across and four feet deep,
known to the islanders as St. Patrick&rsquo;s Vat. At any rate it was
so named at the end of last century. In a quarry at Portpatrick,
Wigtownshire, used in connection with the harbour works, once flowed a
spring dedicated to the saint. On the rock below were formerly to be
seen certain marks, said, by tradition, to be the impression made by
his knees and left hand.</p>
<p>Columban or Columbanus, belonged, like Columba, to the sixth
century. Ireland was also his native land. When he left it he
travelled, not north like Columba, but south, and sought the sunny
lands of France and Italy. In the latter country he founded the
monastery of Bobbio among the Apennines. A writer in the
&ldquo;<i>Antiquary</i>&rdquo; for 1891 remarks, in connection with a
recent visit to this monastery, &ldquo;I was taken to see a rock on the
summit of a mountain called La Spanna, near the cave to which the saint
is said to have retired for prayer and meditation. The impression
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>of the saint&rsquo;s left hand is still shown upon
the face of this rock. The healing power of the patron&rsquo;s hand is
believed by the peasantry of the surrounding country to linger still in
the hollow marking, and many sufferers, climbing to this spot, have
found relief from laying their hand within its palm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to his well beside the Molendinar, at Glasgow, Kentigern
had a chair and bed, both of stone. Concerning the latter, Bishop
Forbes, in his &ldquo;<i>Kalendars of Scottish Saints</i>,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;Kentigern&rsquo;s couch was rather a sepulchre than a bed, and
was of rock, with a stone for a pillow, like Jacob. He rose in the
night and sang psalms and hymns till the second cock-crowing. Then he
rushed into the cold stream, and with eyes fixed on heaven he recited
the whole psalter. Then, coming out of the water he dried his limbs on
a stone on the mountain called Galath, and went forth for his
day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; Kentigern&rsquo;s work took him beyond the
limits of Strathclyde. He seems to have visited the uplands of
Aberdeenshire. The church of Glengairn, a parish now incorporated with
Tullich and Glenmuick, was probably founded by him. At any rate, it was
dedicated to him. A tradition of his untiring zeal survived in
Aberdeenshire down to the beginning of last century. According to a
proverb then current, systematic beneficence was said to be &ldquo;like
St. Mungo&rsquo;s work, which was never done.&rdquo; The Isle of May,
in the Firth of Forth, has, on one of its rocky sides, a small cave
called The Lady&rsquo;s Bed, containing a pool in its floor. As Mr.
Muir <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>points out in his &ldquo;<i>Ecclesiological
Notes</i>,&rdquo; it is traditionally associated with Thenew,
Kentigern&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;who,&rdquo; according to the legend,
&ldquo;after being cast into the sea at Aberlady, was miraculously
floated to the May, and thence, in the same manner, to Culross, where
she was stranded and gave birth to the saint.&rdquo; Columba, when in
Iona, had a stone slab as a bed, and a block of stone as a pillow.
Adamnan mentions that, after the saint&rsquo;s death, this pillow stone
was placed as a monument over his grave.</p>
<p>Guarding Lamlash Bay, where Haco gathered his shattered fleet after
the battle of Largs, in 1263, is Holy Island, known to the Norsemen as
Melansay. In this island is a cave, at one time inhabited by the hermit
Molio, and below it, near the beach, is his Holy Well, for centuries
reckoned efficacious in the cure of disease. A large block of
sandstone, flat on the top, with a series of recesses like seats cut
round its margin, constitutes the saint&rsquo;s chair and table
combined. Molio was educated in Bute by his uncle Blane, to whom the
now ruined St. Blane&rsquo;s Chapel was dedicated. He afterwards went
to Ireland, and was placed under Munna, who is still remembered in the
name of Kilmun, on Holy Loch, in the Firth of Clyde.</p>
<p>Inan, probably the same as Finan, gave name to Inchinnan, in
Renfrewshire, though the ancient church of the parish was dedicated,
not to him, but to Conval. The church at Lamington, in Lanarkshire, was
dedicated to Inan. St. Innian&rsquo;s Well is in the parish. He is the
patron saint of Beith, in Ayrshire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>The annual fair held there in
August is popularly called Tenant&rsquo;s Day&mdash;Tenant being a
corruption of St. Inan. St. Inan&rsquo;s Well and St. Inan&rsquo;s
Chair keep his memory fresh in the district. Some particulars about
them are given by Mr. Robert Love in the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1362"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span>, vol. xi.:&mdash;&ldquo;This chair
is in the rocky hill-face at the west end of the Cuff hills, and from
its elevated position a wide tract of country from south to north is
overlooked. At the base of the hill, and distant from the chair some
hundred yards, is a well called St. Inan&rsquo;s Well, a double spring,
which issues from the rock at two points close by each other, and which
is almost unapproachable in respect of its abundance and purity. This
chair is formed in part, possibly by nature, out of the rock of the
hill. Its back and two sides are closed in, while, in front, to the
west, it is open. The seat proper is above the ground in front about
two feet two inches, is two feet four inches in breadth, and one foot
four inches in depth backwards.&rdquo; Visitors to the seven churches
at Glendalough, in county Wicklow, Ireland, are usually shown St.
Kevin&rsquo;s Seat on a block of rock. As a proof of its genuineness
the mark made by the saint&rsquo;s leg and the impression of his
fingers are duly pointed out by the local guide.</p>
<p>In Kirkmaiden parish, Wigtownshire, the print of the Virgin&rsquo;s
knee was at one time shown on a stone where she knelt in prayer. There
was a chapel dedicated to her in the neighbourhood. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>In
Southend parish, Kintyre, are the remains of St. Columba&rsquo;s
Chapel, standing in the ancient burying-ground of Keil. In his
&ldquo;<i>Ecclesiological Notes</i>&rdquo; Mr. Muir observes,
&ldquo;Under an overhanging rock, close by on the roadside, is St.
Columba&rsquo;s Well, and on the top of a hillock, overlooking the west
end of the burial ground there is a flat rock bearing on its top the
impress of two feet, made, it seems, by those of the saint whilst he
stood marking out and hallowing the spot on which his chapel should
rest.&rdquo; In Bromfield parish, Cumberland, is a piece of granite
rock called St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s Stane, and near it is a copious spring
of remarkably pure water. Brand, in his &ldquo;<i>Popular
Antiquities</i>,&rdquo; says that &ldquo;this spring, probably from its
having been anciently dedicated to the same St. Cuthbert, is called
Helly Well, <i>i.e.</i>, Haly or Holy Well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. R. C. Hope, in his &ldquo;<i>Holy Wells</i>,&rdquo; refers to a
block of stone near St. Madron&rsquo;s Spring, in Cornwall, locally
known as St. Madron&rsquo;s Bed. We are told that &ldquo;on it impotent
folk reclined when they came to try the cold water cure.&rdquo; In the
same parish is a pre-historic relic in the form of a granite block with
a hole in the centre of it. It is known in Cornish as Mean-an-Tol,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Stone of the Hole. Its name in English is The Creeping
Stone. Sickly children were at one time passed through the hole a
certain number of times, in the belief that a cure would follow. This
superstitious custom recalls what was at one time done beside St.
Paul&rsquo;s Well, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>parish of Fyvie, Aberdeenshire. Close
to the well were the ruins of an old church. One of its stones was
supported on other two with a space below. It went by the name of The
Shargar Stone&mdash;shargar signifying a weakly child. The stone, in
this instance, got its name from the custom in the district of mothers
passing their ailing children through the space below the stone, in the
belief that whatever hindered their growth would thereby be removed.
Mr. Hope recounts a tradition concerning Morwenstowe, in Devon, and its
patron saint, Morwenna, to the effect that when the parishioners wished
to build a church, Morwenna brought a large stone from the foot of the
cliff to form the font. Feeling fatigued by the climb she laid down the
stone to rest herself, and from the spot a spring gushed forth.</p>
<p>On the top of green Dunfillan, in the parish of Comrie, is a rocky
seat known in the district as Fillan&rsquo;s Chair. Here, according to
tradition, the saint sat and gave his blessing to the country around.
Towards the end of last century, and doubtless even later, this chair
was associated with a superstitious remedy for rheumatism in the back.
The person to be cured sat in the chair, and then, lying on his back,
was dragged down the hill by the legs. The influence of the saint
lingering about the spot was believed to insure recovery. St.
Fillan&rsquo;s Spring, at the hill-foot, has already been referred to,
in connection with its mysterious change of site. It was much
frequented at one time by old and young, especially on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>1st May
and 1st August. The health seekers walked or were carried thrice round
the spring from east to west, following the course of the sun. The next
part of the ritual consisted in the use of the water for drinking and
washing, in throwing a white stone on the saint&rsquo;s cairn, near the
spring, and in leaving a rag as an offering before departing. In 1791
not fewer than seventy persons visited the spot at the dates mentioned.
The writer of the article on Comrie in the &ldquo;<i>Old Statistical
Account of Scotland</i>&rdquo; supplies these particulars, and adds,
&ldquo;At the foot of the hill there is a basin made by the saint on
the top of a large stone, which seldom wants water, even in the
greatest drought, and all who are distressed with sore eyes must wash
them three times with this water.&rdquo; Fillan, to whom Comrie parish
is thus so much indebted, flourished about the sixth century, and must
not be confounded with the other missionary of the same name, who dwelt
more than a century later, in the straths of the Fillan and the
Dochart, between Tyndrum and Killin. Concerning the former, Dr. Skene
writes in his &ldquo;<i>Celtic Scotland</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;Fillan,
called Anlobar or &lsquo;the leper,&rsquo; whose day is 20th June, is
said in the Irish calendar to have been of <i>Rath Erenn in Alban</i>,
or the fort of the Earn in Scotland, and St. Fillans, at the east end
of Loch Earn, takes its name from him; while the church of Aberdour, on
the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, is also dedicated to
him.&rdquo; The other Fillan had his Chapel and Holy Pool halfway
between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>Tyndrum and Crianlarich. He is also connected with
Fife. At Pittenweem, in that county, his cave is to be seen, and in it
is his holy well, supplied with water from crevices in the rock. At the
mill of Killin, in Perthshire, once stood a block of stone, known as
St. Fillan&rsquo;s Chair. Close to the spot flows the Dochart, and some
person or persons, whose muscles were stronger than their antiquarian
instincts, sought not unsuccessfully to throw the relic into the river.
The Renfrewshire parish of Killallan, united in 1760 to that of
Houston, got its name from Fillan. Its ancient church, now ruined, was
dedicated to him. Near the ruins, are a stone with a hollow in it and a
spring, called respectively St. Fillan&rsquo;s Seat and St.
Fillan&rsquo;s Well.</p>
<p>About two miles and a half to the south-east of Dunfermline, is a
block of stone, believed to be the last remnant of a group of
pre-historic Standing Stones. According to tradition, it was used by
Queen Margaret, as a seat where she rested, when on her way to and from
the ferry over the Forth. A farm in the immediate neighbourhood is
called St. Margaret&rsquo;s Stone Farm, after the block in question. In
his &ldquo;<i>Annals of Dunfermline</i>&rdquo; Dr. Henderson says,
&ldquo;In 1856 this stone was removed to an adjacent site, by order of
the road surveyor, in order to widen the road which required no
widening, as no additional traffic was likely to ensue, but the
reverse; it is therefore much to be regretted that the old landmark was
removed. It is in contemplation to have the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>old
stone replaced on its old site (as nearly as possible) and made to
rest, with secure fixings, on a massive base or plinth stone.&rdquo;
Not far from the town of Cromarty is St. Bennet&rsquo;s Spring, beside
the ruins of St. Bennet&rsquo;s Chapel. Close to the spot once stood a
stone trough, termed The Fairies&rsquo; Cradle. Hugh Miller, in his
&ldquo;<i>Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; says
that this trough was &ldquo;famous for virtues derived from the saint,
like those of the well. For, if a child was carried away by the fairies
and some mischievous imp left in its place, the parents had only to lay
the changeling in this trough, and, by some invisible process, their
child would be immediately restored to them. The Fairies&rsquo; Cradle
came to a sudden end about the year 1745. It was then broken to pieces
by the parish minister, with the assistance of two of his elders, that
it might no longer serve the purposes of superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following, from the Rev. Dr. Gregor&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Folklore
of the North-East of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; has certainly nothing to do
with a saint, but in other respects, has a bearing on the subject in
hand:&mdash;&ldquo;The Pot o&rsquo; Pittenyoul is a small but romantic
rock-pool in a little stream called the &lsquo;Burn o&rsquo; the
Riggins,&rsquo; which flows past the village of Newmills of Keith. On
the edge of the pool are some hollows worn away by the water and the
small stones and sand carried down by the stream. These hollows to a
lively imagination have the shape of a seat, and the story <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>is, that
the devil, at some far-back time, sat down on the edge of the pool and
left his mark.&rdquo; Probably at an equally distant date, the devil
made his presence felt, further south, though in a different way. He
had great objections to a church built at Invergowrie, in Perthshire,
and, in order to knock it down, hurled a huge boulder across the Tay
from the opposite coast of Fife. We are not aware that the stone struck
the church. At any rate it can be seen in the grounds of Greystane, a
property to which, according to local tradition, it gave name. Sir
William Wallace, though never canonized, had certainly more of the
saint about him than the last-mentioned personage. We find various
traditions concerning him in the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire. His
connection with Lanark is well known. At Biggar, he is said, by Blind
Harry, to have defeated the English, who greatly outnumbered his
forces. This battle took place on Biggar Moss. A few days before the
fight, he entered the enemy&rsquo;s camp, disguised as a cadger or
pedlar, to discover the strength of the English army. Being pursued, he
turned on his assailants while crossing a bridge over Biggar Water, a
little to the west of the town. A foot-bridge there still goes by the
name of The Cadger&rsquo;s Bridge. A rock with a hollow in it, lying to
the north of Vizzyberry, is locally styled Wallace&rsquo;s Seat, and a
spring near the spot is still known as Wallace&rsquo;s Well.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Healing and holy have an etymological kinship. The one
is commonly associated with matters relating to the body, and the other
with those relating to the soul. If the body is healed, it is said to
be whole and its owner hale; and if the soul is healed, it is said to
be holy. All these words have one idea in common, and hence we need not
wonder that healing wells were, as a rule, reckoned holy wells, and
vice versa. When speaking of the virtues of such wells, Mrs. Stone, in
her &ldquo;<i>God&rsquo;s Acre</i>,&rdquo; puts the point exactly, if
somewhat quaintly, when she says, &ldquo;Before chemistry was born,
when medical science was little known, these medical virtues, so
plainly and indisputably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>ostensible, were attributed to the
beneficence of the saint or angel to whom the spring had been
dedicated.&rdquo; Many still go to Moffat, Bridge-of-Allan, and
Strathpeffer to drink the waters, but probably, none of those
health-seekers now rely on magic for a cure. It was quite otherwise in
former times. Cures wrought at Lourdes are still believed, by many, to
be due to the blessing of the water by the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Not far from the highway between Ayr and Prestwick once stood a
lazar-house called King&rsquo;s Ease or King&rsquo;s Case, known in the
sixteenth century as Kilcaiss. Its ruins were to be seen till well on
in the present century. According to tradition, the hospital was
founded for lepers by King Robert Bruce, who was himself afflicted with
a disease believed to be leprosy. This was done as a thank-offering,
for benefit received from the water of a neighbouring well. The spring
was doubtless sacred to some saint, probably to Ninian, to whom the
hospital was dedicated, and we can safely infer that the patron got the
credit of the cure. To maintain the lepers the king gifted various
lands to the hospital, among others, those of Robertlone, in Dundonald
parish, and of Sheles and Spital-Sheles, in Kyle Stewart. The right of
presentation to the hospital was vested in the family of Wallace of
Craigie. At a later date the lands belonging to the charity passed into
other hands. In the third volume of his &ldquo;<i>Caledonia</i>,&rdquo;
published in 1824, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span>Chalmers remarks, &ldquo;The only revenue
that remained to it was the feu-duties payable from the lands granted
in fee-firm, and these, amounting to 64 bolls of meal and 8 marks Scots
of money, with 16 threaves of straw for thatching the hospital, are
still paid. For more than two centuries past the diminished revenue has
been shared among eight objects of charity in equal shares of 8 bolls
of meal and 1 mark Scots to each. The leprosy having long disappeared,
the persons who are now admitted to the benefit of this charity are
such as labour under diseases which are considered as incurable, or
such as are in indigent circumstances.&rdquo; In the time of Charles
I., the persons enjoying the benefit of the charity lived in huts or
cottages in the vicinity of the chapel. In 1787 the right of
presentation was bought from the Wallaces by the burgh of Ayr, and the
poorhouse there is thus the lineal descendant of King Robert&rsquo;s
hospital. Mr. R. C. Hope, in his &ldquo;<i>Holy Wells</i>,&rdquo;
alludes to the interesting fact that Bruce had a free pass from the
English king to visit Muswell, near London, close to the site of the
Alexandra Palace. This well, dedicated to St. Lazarus, at one time
belonged to the hospital order of St. John&rsquo;s, Clerkenwell, and
was resorted to in cases of leprosy. Bruce&rsquo;s foundation at Ayr
recalls another at Stony Middleton, in Derbyshire. The latter, however,
was a chapel, and not a hospital. Tradition says that a crusader,
belonging to the district, was cured of leprosy by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>means of
the mineral water there, and that in gratitude he built a chapel and
dedicated it to his patron saint, Martin.</p>
<p>In glancing at the history of holy wells, it is not difficult to
understand why certain springs were endowed with mysterious properties.
When there were no chemists to analyse mineral springs, anyone tasting
the water would naturally enough think that there was something strange
about it, a notion that would not vanish with the first draught. The
wonder, too, would grow if the water was found to put fresh vigour into
wearied frames. Alum wells, like the one in Carnwath parish,
Lanarkshire, would, through their astringent qualities, arrest
attention. A well at Halkirk, Caithness, must have been a cause of
wonder, if we judge by the description given of it in the &ldquo;<i>Old
Statistical Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; where we read, that
&ldquo;on its surface lies always a thin beautiful kind of substance,
that varies like the plumage of the peacock displayed in all its glory
to the rays of the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The petrifying power of certain springs would also tend to bring
them into notice. There is a famous well of this kind near Tarras
Water, in Canonbie parish, Dumfriesshire. In Kirkmaiden parish,
Wigtownshire, is a dropping cave, known as Peter&rsquo;s Paps. In
former times it was resorted to by persons suffering from
whooping-cough. The treatment consisted in standing with upturned face
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>below the drop, and allowing it to fall into the
open mouth. For more than two centuries and a half, the mineral waters
of Peterhead have been famous for both internal and external use,
though their fame is not now so great as formerly. Towards the end of
the seventeenth century, they were spoken of as one of the six wonders
of Buchan. The principal well is situated to the south of the town, and
is popularly called the Wine Well. Its water is strongly impregnated
with carbonic acid, muriate of iron, muriate of lime, and muriate of
soda. The chalybeate spring in the Moss of Melshach, in Kennethmont
parish, had at one time a considerable local reputation for the cure of
man and beast. Clothes of the former and harness of the latter were
left beside the well. Visits were paid to it in the month of May.
Another Aberdeenshire health-resort formerly attracted many visitors,
viz., Pannanich, near Ballater, with its four chalybeate springs. These
are said to have been accidentally discovered, about the middle of last
century, but were then probably only rediscovered. They were at first
found beneficial in the case of scrofula, and were afterwards deemed
infallible in all diseases. In his &ldquo;<i>Antiquities and Scenery of
the North of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; Cordiner, under date 1776, writes:
&ldquo;In coming down these hilly regions, stopped the first night at
&lsquo;Pananach-lodge:&rsquo; an extensive building opposite to the
strange rocks and pass of Bolliter. There, a mineral well and baths,
whose virtues have been often experienced, are become <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>much
frequented by the infirm. The lodge, containing a number of
bed-chambers, and a spacious public room, is fitted up for the
accommodation of those who come to take the benefit of the waters. Goat
whey is also there obtained in the greatest perfection.&rdquo; Almost a
century later, another visitor to the spot, viz., Queen Victoria, thus
writes, in her &ldquo;<i>More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in the
Highlands</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;I had driven with Beatrice to Pannanich
wells, where I had been many years ago. Unfortunately, almost all the
trees which covered the hills have been cut down. We got out and tasted
the water, which is strongly impregnated with iron, and looked at the
bath and at the humble, but very clean, accommodation in the curious
little old inn, which used to be very much frequented.&rdquo; The Well
of Spa, at Aberdeen, was more famous in former times than it is now.
There are two springs, both of them chalybeate. The amount of iron in
the water, however, diminished very considerably more than fifty years
ago&mdash;a change due to certain digging operations in the
neighbourhood. The present structure connected with the well was
renovated in 1851. It was built in 1670 to replace an earlier one,
repaired by George Jamieson, the artist, but soon afterwards completely
demolished by the overflowing of the adjoining Denburn. The present
building, according to Mr. A. Jervise, in the fourth volume of the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;bears representations of the Scottish
Thistle, the Rose of England, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>Fleur-de-lis of France,
surmounting this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;As heaven gives me</p>
<p class="line">So give I thee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Below these words is a carving of the rising sun, and
the following altered quotation from Horace:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Hoc fonte derivata Salus</p>
<p class="line">In patriam populumque fluat.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; continues Mr. Jervise,
&ldquo;that the virtues of this Spa were early known and appreciated,
for in 1615 record says that there was &lsquo;a long wyde stone which
conveyed the waters from the spring, with the portraicture of six
Apostles hewen upon either side thereof.&rsquo; It is described as
having then been &lsquo;verie old and worne.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unusual kind of holy well, viz., one, in which salt water takes
the place of fresh, is to be found in the case of the Chapel Wells in
Kirkmaiden parish, Wigtownshire, half way between the bays of
Portankill and East Tarbet. About thirty yards to the north-west are
the ruins of St. Medan&rsquo;s Chapel, partly artificial and partly
natural, a cave forming the inner portion. In days gone by, the spot
was much frequented on the first Sunday of May (<abbr title=
"Old Style">O.S.</abbr>), called Co&rsquo; Sunday, after this cave or
cove. Dr. Robert Trotter, who examined the chapel and the wells in
1870, gives the results of the observations in the eighth volume of the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; (new series). He says, &ldquo;These
wells&mdash;three natural cavities in a mass of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>porphyritic trap&mdash;are within the tide mark,
and are filled by the sea at high water of ordinary tides. The largest
is circular, five feet in diameter at the top, and four feet at one
side, shelving down to five feet at the other, and is wider inside than
at the top, something like a kailpot in fact, and it is so close to the
edge of the rock that at one place its side is not two inches thick.
The other wells almost touch it, and are about one foot six inches wide
and deep respectively.&rdquo; Sickly children were brought to be
bathed, the time selected being just before sunrise. Dr. Trotter
mentions that children are still brought occasionally, sometimes from
long distances. The ceremony described to him by an eyewitness was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The child was stripped naked, and taken by the
spaul&mdash;that is, by one of the legs&mdash;and plunged headforemost
into the big well till completely submerged; it was then pulled out,
and the part held on by was dipped in the middle well, and then the
whole body was finished by washing the eyes in the smallest one,
altogether very like the Achilles and Styx business, only much more
thorough. An offering was then left in the old chapel, on a projecting
stone inside the cave behind the west door, and the cure was
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much uncertainty attaches to Medan or Medana, the tutelar saint of
the spot. One legend makes her a contemporary of Ninian. According to
another, she lived about one hundred years later. Dr. Skene thinks she
is probably the same as Monenna, otherwise <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>Edana,
who is said to have founded churches in Galloway, and at Edinburgh,
Stirling and Longforgan. Kirkmaiden parish, at one time called
Kirkmaiden <i>in Ryndis</i>, is believed to be named after her, like
the other parish known as Kirkmaiden <i>in Farnes</i>, now united to
the parish of Glasserton. An incident in her history has a bearing on
the present subject. According to the Aberdeen Breviary, she fled from
her home in Ireland to escape from the importunities of a certain noble
knight who sought to marry her. Accompanied by two handmaidens, she
crossed to Galloway and took up her abode in the Rhinns. The knight
followed her. When Medana saw him she placed herself along with her
maidens on a rock in the sea. By a miracle, this rock became a boat,
and she was conveyed over the water to Farnes. Again the knight
appeared. This time Medana sought refuge among the branches of a tree,
and, from this coign of vantage, asked her lover what it was that made
him pursue her so persistently. &ldquo;Your face and eyes,&rdquo;
replied the knight. Thereupon Medana plucked out her eyes and threw
them down at the feet of her lover, who was so filled with grief and
penitence that he immediately departed. On the spot where her eyes fell
a spring of water gushed forth, and in it Medana washed her face,
doubtless thereby restoring her sight. There is much to favour the view
taken by Dr. Trotter: that &ldquo;possibly the well was the original
institution; the cave a shelter or dwelling for the genius who
discovered the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>miraculous virtues of the water, and his
successors; and the chapel a later edition for the benefit of the
clergy, who supplanted the old religion by grafting Christianity upon
it, St. Medana being a still later institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Catherine&rsquo;s Balm Well, at Liberton, near Edinburgh, is
still considered beneficial in the treatment of cutaneous affections.
The spring is situated on a small estate, called after it, St.
Catherine&rsquo;s. Peter Swave, who visited Scotland in 1535, on a
political mission, mentions that near Edinburgh there was a spot in a
monastery where oil flowed out of the ground. This was his way of
describing the Balm Well. Bitumenous particles, produced by
decomposition of coal in seams beneath, intermittently appear on the
surface of the water. This curious phenomenon must have attracted
attention at a very early period, and one can easily understand why the
well was in consequence regarded with superstitious reverence. When
speaking of this well, Brome, who visited Scotland about 1700,
observes, &ldquo;It is of a marvellous nature, for as the coal whereof
it proceeds is very apt quickly to kindle into a flame, so is the oil
of a sudden operation to heal all scabs and tumours that trouble the
outward skin; and the head and hands are speedily healed by virtue of
this oil, which retains a very sweet smell.&rdquo; According to Boece,
the fountain sprang from a drop of oil, brought to Queen Margaret of
Scotland, from the tomb of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. The same
writer mentions that Queen Margaret built a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>chapel
to St. Catherine, in the neighbourhood of the spring. In 1504 an
offering was made by James IV. in this chapel, described as
&ldquo;Sanct Kathrine&rsquo;s of the oly, i.e., oily well.&rdquo; The
later history of the spring is thus referred to by Sir Daniel Wilson,
in his &ldquo;<i>Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time</i>&rdquo;:
&ldquo;When James VI. returned to Scotland, in 1617, he visited the
well, and commanded it to be enclosed with an ornamental building with
a flight of steps to afford ready access to the healing waters; but
this was demolished by the soldiers of Cromwell, and the well now
remains enclosed with plain stone-work, as it was partially repaired at
the Restoration.&rdquo; About three miles to the north of the well,
once stood the Convent of St. Catherine of Sienna&mdash;a religious
foundation which gave name to the part of Edinburgh still called
&ldquo;The Sciennes.&rdquo; What Sir Daniel Wilson describes as
&ldquo;an unpicturesque fragment of the ruins&rdquo; served to the
middle of the present century, and perhaps, even later, as a sheep-fold
for the flocks pasturing in the adjoining meadow. Lord Cockburn, in his
&ldquo;<i>Memorials of His Time</i>,&rdquo; mentions that in his
boyhood, about 1785, &ldquo;a large portion of the building
survived.&rdquo; Before the Reformation the nuns of this convent walked
annually in solemn procession to the Balm Well. The saints to whom the
convent and the spring were respectively dedicated were, of course, not
identical, though bearing the same name. The coincidence of name,
however, evidently led to these yearly visits. As it may be taken for
granted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>that the two Catherines were on friendly terms,
the pilgrimages doubtless proved a benefit to all who took part in
them. At any rate, it is safe to assume that the health of the pilgrims
would be the better, and not the worse, for their walk in the fresh
country air.</p>
<p>In the valley below the Dean Bridge, Edinburgh, close to the Water
of Leith, is the sulphur spring known as St. Bernard&rsquo;s
Well&mdash;traditionally connected with Bernard the Abbot of Clairvaux.
In his &ldquo;<i>Journey through Scotland</i>,&rdquo; about 1793, Heron
remarks: &ldquo;The citizens of Edinburgh repaired eagerly to distant
watering-places, without inquiring whether they might find medicinal
water at home. But within these few years, Lord Gardenstone became
proprietor of St. Bernard&rsquo;s Well. His lordship&rsquo;s
philanthropy and public spirit suggested to him the possibility of
rendering its waters more useful to the public. He has, at a very
considerable expense, built a handsome Grecian edifice over the spring,
in which the waters are distributed by a proper person, and at a very
trifling price. His lordship&rsquo;s endeavours have accomplished his
purpose. The citizens of Edinburgh are now persuaded that these waters
are salutary in various cases; and have, particularly, a singular
tendency to give a good breakfasting appetite; in consequence of which,
old and young, males and females, have, for these two or three last
summers, crowded to pay their morning respects to Hygeia in the chapel
which Lord Gardenstone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>has erected to her.&rdquo; The last allusion
is to a statue of Hygeia placed within the building on its erection, in
1789. The goddess of health, however, eventually showed signs of
decrepitude; and, about a hundred years later, the original statue was
replaced by one in marble through the liberality of the late Mr.
William Nelson, who also restored the pump-room and made the
surroundings more attractive.</p>
<p>Coming next to consider the case of springs not possessing medicinal
qualities, in other words, such as have no taste save that of clear and
sparkling water, we find here, too, many a trace of superstition.
Springs of this kind were probably <i>holy</i> wells first, and then
<i>healing</i> wells. We have already seen that, in a large number of
instances, fountains became sacred through their connection with early
saints. It usually happened that the Christian missionary took up his
abode near some fountain, or river, whence he could get a supply of
water for his daily needs. In later times the well or stream was
endowed with miraculous properties. Water was also used for purposes of
bodily discipline. It was a practice among some of the early saints to
stand immersed in it while engaged in devotion. The colder the water,
the better was it for the purpose. Special significance, too, was given
to water through its connection with baptism, particularly when the
rite was administered to persons who had only recently emerged from
heathenism.</p>
<p>At Burghead, in Elginshire, is an interesting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>rock-cut
basin supplied with water from a spring. Burghead is known to have been
the site of an early Christian church, and Dr. James Macdonald believes
that the basin in question was anciently used as a baptistery. All
trace of it, and well-nigh all memory of it, had vanished till the year
1809. Extensive alterations were then in progress at the harbour, and a
scarcity of water was felt by the workmen. A hazy tradition about the
existence of a well, where the ground sounded hollow when struck, was
revived. Digging operations were begun, and, at a depth of between
twenty and thirty feet below the surface, the basin was discovered. We
quote the following details from Dr. Macdonald&rsquo;s article on the
subject in the &ldquo;<i>Antiquary</i>&rdquo; for April,
1892:&mdash;&ldquo;Descending into a hollow by a flight of twenty
well-worn steps, most of them also hewn out of the solid rock, we come
upon the reservoir. The dimensions of the basin or piscina are as
follow&mdash;greatest breadth of the four sides, ten feet eight inches,
eleven feet, ten feet ten inches, and ten feet seven inches
respectively; depth, four feet four inches. One part of the smooth
bottom had been dug up at the time of the excavations, either because
it had projected above the rest, as if for some one to stand upon, or
because it was thought that by doing so the capacity of the well and
perhaps the supply of the water would be increased. Between the basin
and the perpendicular sides of the reservoir a small ledge of sandstone
has been left about two feet six <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>inches in breadth. These
sides measure sixteen feet three inches, sixteen feet seven inches,
sixteen feet nine inches, and seventeen feet respectively; and the
height from the ledge upwards is eleven feet nine inches. The angles,
both of the basin and its rock walls, are well rounded. In one corner
the sandstone has been left in the form of a semi-circular pedestal,
measuring two feet nine inches by one foot ten inches, and one foot two
inches in height; whilst in that diagonally opposite there is a
circular hole, five inches in diameter and one foot four inches in
depth. From the ledge, as you enter, two steps of irregular shape and
rude workmanship lead down into the basin. The sides of the reservoir
are fissured and rent by displacement of the strata; and portions of
the rock, that have given way from time to time, have been replaced by
modern masonry. The arched roof is also modern.&rdquo; An Irish legend
accounts for the origin of Lough-shanan, in County Clare, by connecting
it with the baptism of Senanus, from whom it derived its name.
&ldquo;The saint, while still an infant, was miraculously gifted with
speech and told his mother to pluck three rushes in a valley near her
home. When this was done, a lake appeared, and in it Senanus was
baptised according to a form of words prescribed by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the eighth volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>&rdquo; (new series), Sir Daniel Wilson
gives an account of the ancient burying-ground of Kilbride, some three
miles from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>Oban. &ldquo;I had visited the venerable
cemetery repeatedly,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;and had carefully
investigated its monuments, without heeding the sacred fountain which
wells up among the bracken and grass, about a dozen yards from the gate
of the churchyard, and flows in a stream down the valley. Yet, on
inquiry, I learned that it was familiarly known as Tober-an-easbuig,
i.e., The Bishop&rsquo;s Well or The Holy Well. Here, as we may
presume, the primitive missionary and servant of St. Bridget, by whom
Christianity was introduced into the wild district of Lorne, baptised
his first converts; and here, through many succeeding generations, the
neophytes were signed with the sign of the cross, and taught the mystic
significance of the holy rite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thoughts suggested by the sight of a crystal spring are alluded
to by Mr. Hunt in his &ldquo;<i>Romances of the West of
England</i>,&rdquo; where he says, &ldquo;The tranquil beauty of the
rising waters, whispering the softest music, like the healthful
breathing of a sleeping infant, sends a feeling of happiness through
the soul of the thoughtful observer, and the inner man is purified by
its influence, as the outer man is cleansed by ablution.&rdquo; This is
the poetic view; but the superstitious view is not far to seek.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;<i>Home of a Naturalist</i>,&rdquo; Mrs. Saxby thus
recounts a Shetland superstition of a gruesome kind:&mdash;&ldquo;There
is a fine spring well near Watlie, called Heljabr&uuml;n, and the
legend of it is this: A wandering packman (of the Claud Halcro class)
was murdered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>and flung into Heljabr&uuml;n. Its water had
always been known to possess healing power, and, after becoming
seasoned by the unfortunate pedlar&rsquo;s remains, the virtue in the
water became even more efficacious. People came from far and near to
procure the precious fluid. All who took it away had to throw three
stones or a piece of &lsquo;white money&rsquo; into the well, and the
water never failed to cure disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Soutra Hill, the most westerly ridge of the Lammermoors, once
stood the hospital built by Malcolm IV., about 1164, for the reception
of wayfarers. It was dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Every vestige of
the building was removed between forty and fifty years ago except a
small aisle, appropriated in the seventeenth century by the Pringles of
Beatman&rsquo;s Acre as a burial vault. A short distance below the site
of the hospital is a spring of pure water, locally known as Trinity
Well. In former times it was much visited for its healing virtues. A
similar reputation was for long enjoyed by St. Mungo&rsquo;s Well, on
the west side of St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hill, in the parish of Huntly,
Aberdeenshire. In Fortingall parish, Perthshire, on the hillside near
the Old Castle of Garth, is a limpid spring called by the natives
Fuaran n&rsquo; Gruarach, and also Fuaran n&rsquo; Druibh Chasad,
signifying the Well of the Measles and the Well of the Whooping-Cough
respectively. Mr. James Mackintosh Gow describes the locality in an
article in the eighth volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>&rdquo; (new series). He says,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>&ldquo;It was famous in the district for the
cure of these infantile diseases, and nearly all I spoke to on the
subject had themselves been taken to the well, or had taken their own
children to drink the water; and when an epidemic of the maladies
occurred my informant remarked on the curious and amusing spectacle the
scene presented on a summer morning, when groups of children, with
their mothers, went up the hill in procession. The last epidemic of
whooping-cough occurred in 1882, when all the children of the
neighbourhood were taken to the well.&rdquo; Some forty yards higher up
the slope than the well, is an earth-fast boulder of mica schist,
having on one of its sides two natural cavities. The larger of these
holds about a quart and is usually filled with rain water. &ldquo;It
was the custom,&rdquo; Mr. Gow tells us, &ldquo;to carry the water from
the well (perhaps the well was at one time at the foot of the stone)
and place it in the cavity, and then give the patients as much as they
could take, the water being administered with a spoon made from the
horn of a living cow, called a <i>beodhare</i> or living horn; this, it
appears, being essential to effect a cure.&rdquo; On the farm of
Balandonich, in Athole, is a spring famous, till a comparatively recent
period, for the cure of various maladies. A story is told in the
district of a woman, unable to walk through rheumatism, having been
brought in a wheel-barrow from her home four miles away. She bathed her
limbs in the spring, and returned home on foot. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hugh Miller, in his &ldquo;<i>Scenes and Legends of the North of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; recounts a tradition concerning a certain spring
near the town of Cromarty known as Fiddler&rsquo;s Well, from the name
of the young man who discovered its virtues. The water gushes out from
the side of a bank covered with moss and daisies. The tradition,
considerably abbreviated, is as follows:&mdash;William Fiddler and a
companion were seized with consumption at the same time. The latter
died not long afterwards, and Fiddler, though wasted to a shadow, was
able to follow his friend&rsquo;s body to the grave. That night, in a
dream, he heard the voice of his dead companion, who told him to meet
him at a certain spot in the neighbourhood of the town. Thither he
went, still in his dream, and seated himself on a bank to await his
coming. Then, remembering that his friend was dead, he burst into
tears. &ldquo;At this moment a large field-bee came humming from the
west and began to fly round his head&#8202;&hellip;. It hummed
ceaselessly round and round him, until at length its murmurings seemed
to be fashioned into words, articulated in the voice of his deceased
companion&mdash;&lsquo;Dig, Willie, and drink!&rsquo; it said,
&lsquo;Dig, Willie, and drink!&rsquo; He accordingly set himself to
dig, and no sooner had he torn a sod out of the bank than a spring of
clear water gushed from the hollow.&rdquo; Next day he took the
bee&rsquo;s advice. He found a spring, drank the water, and regained
his health. Hugh Miller adds, &ldquo;its virtues are still celebrated,
for though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>the water be only simple water it must be drunk
in the morning, and as it gushes from the bank; and, with pure air,
exercise, and early rising for its auxiliaries, it continues to work
cures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need not multiply examples of non-mineral healing wells. Whatever
benefit may be derived from them cannot be ascribed to any specially
medicinal quality in their waters. The secret of their popularity is to
be sought for in the annals of medical folklore, and not in those of
scientific medicine.</p>
<p>Certain springs got the credit of warding off disease. On the island
of Gigha, near the west coast of Kintyre, is a farm called Ardachad or
High Field. Tradition says that a plague once visited the island, but
that the people, belonging to the farm, escaped its ravages. This
immunity was ascribed to the good offices of a well, in an adjoining
field. The high situation of the farm and the presence of good water
would tend to prolong health, without the intervention of magic. The
Rev. Dr. Gregor, in his &ldquo;<i>Folklore of the North-East of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; alludes to St. Olaus&rsquo; Well in Cruden parish,
Aberdeenshire. Its virtues are recorded in the couplet&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;St. Olav&rsquo;s Well, low by the sea</p>
<p class="line">Where peat nor plague shall never be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">On the top of the Touch Hills, in Stirlingshire, rises
St. Corbet&rsquo;s Spring. The belief formerly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>prevailed that whoever drank its water before
sunrise on the first Sunday of May would have life prolonged for
another year. As a consequence, crowds flocked to the spot early on the
day in question. In 1840 some old people were still living who, in
their younger days, had taken part in these annual pilgrimages. In
medi&aelig;val times, the belief prevailed that no one baptised with
the water of Trinity Gask Well, Perthshire, would be attacked by the
plague. When water for baptism was drawn from some holy well in the
neighbourhood, its use, in most instances, was doubtless due to a
belief in its prophylactic power. As already mentioned, baptisms in St.
Machar&rsquo;s Cathedral, Old Aberdeen, were at one time administered
in water taken from the saint&rsquo;s spring. Before the Reformation
the water used at the chapel of Airth, in Stirlingshire, is believed to
have been procured from a well, dedicated to the Virgin, near Abbeyton
Bridge. We do not know of any spring in Scotland with a reputation for
the prevention of hydrophobia. St. Maelrubha&rsquo;s Well, on Innis
Maree, is said to have lost its efficacy for a time through contact
with a mad dog. What happened, when a mad bull was plunged into the
Holy Pool at Strathfillan, will be alluded to later. In the village of
Les Saintes Maries, in the south of France, is an interesting
twelfth-century church with a well in the crypt. The water, when drunk,
is said to prevent any evil consequences from the bite of a mad dog.
Mr. E. H. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>Barker gives an account of this well in his
&ldquo;<i>Wayfaring in France</i>.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;The
cur&eacute; told me that about thirty people, who had been bitten by
dogs said to be rabid, came annually to drink the water; and, he added,
&lsquo;not one of them has ever gone mad.&rsquo; M. Pasteur had become
a formidable rival of the well.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Some people apply to different doctors in succession,
in the hope that new professional advice may bring the coveted boon of
health. For the same reason visits were paid to different consecrated
wells. On the principle that &ldquo;far fowls have fair
feathers,&rdquo; a more or less remote spring was resorted to, in the
hope that distance might lend special enchantment to its water. Certain
springs had the reputation of healing every ailment. A spring of this
kind is what Martin calls &ldquo;a catholicon for all diseases.&rdquo;
He so styles various springs in the Western Isles, and one in the
Larger Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde. Fivepennies Well, in Eigg, had
some curious properties. &ldquo;The natives told me,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;that it never fails to cure any person <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>of
their first disease, only by drinking a quantity of it for the space of
two or three days; and that if a stranger lie at this well in the
night-time, it will procure a deformity in some part of his body, but
has no such effect on a native; and this, they say, hath been
frequently experimented.&rdquo; A noted fountain in the Orkney group
was the well of Kildinguie in the Island of Stronsay. It is situated
not far from the beach. To reach it one has to walk over a long stretch
of sand. Its fame at one time spread over the Scandinavian world, and
even Denmark sent candidates for its help. Besides drinking the water,
health-seekers frequently ate some of the dulse to be found on the
shore. A local saying thus testified to the advantages of the combined
treatment: &ldquo;The well of Kildinguie and the dulse of Guiyidn can
cure all maladies except black death.&rdquo; In the Island of Skye is a
spring called Tobar Tellibreck. The natives, at one time, held that its
water, along with a diet of dulse, would serve for a considerable time
instead of ordinary food.</p>
<p>Other springs were resorted to for particular complaints. Toothache
is distressingly common, and commonly distressing; but, strange to say,
very few wells are specially identified with the ailment. Indeed, we
know of only three toothache wells in Scotland. One is in Strathspey,
and is known as Fuaran Fiountag, signifying <i>the cool refreshing
spring</i>. The second is in the parish of Kenmore, at the foot of Loch
Tay. The third is in Glentruim, in Inverness-shire. Another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>well at Kenmore was resorted to for the cure of
sore eyes. In the parish of Glass, close to the river Deveron, is an
ancient church dedicated to St. Wallach. Some thirty yards below its
burying-ground is a well, now dry, except in very rainy weather. Its
water had the power of healing sore eyes. The water of St. John&rsquo;s
Well, at Balmanno, in the parish of Marykirk, Kincardineshire, was a
sovereign remedy for the same complaint. Beside the road close to the
farmhouse of Wester Auchleskine, at Balquhidder, in Perthshire, once
stood a large boulder containing a natural cavity. The water in this
hollow was also noted for the cure of sore eyes&mdash;the boulder being
called in consequence Clach-nan-Sul, <i>i.e.</i>, the stone of the
eyes. In 1878, by order of the road trustees, the boulder was blasted,
on the ground that it was a source of danger to vehicles in the dark,
and its fragments were used as road metal. The Dow Well, at
Innerleithen, was formerly much visited for the restoration of weak
sight. A well in Cornwall, dedicated to St. Ludvan, miraculously
quickened the sense of sight. In Ireland, a spring at Gougou Barra,
between Glengariff and Cork, is believed by the peasantry to cure
blindness. In 1849, Miss Bessie Gilbert, a daughter of the late Bishop
Gilbert of Chichester, who had lost her sight when a child, visited the
spring along with some of her relatives. Curiosity, however, was her
only motive. Her biographer relates that &ldquo;the guide besought
Bessie in the most earnest and pathetic manner to try the water, saying
that he was sure it would restore her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>sight, and entreating
her brothers and sisters to urge her to make use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Headaches and nervous disorders were cured by water from
Tobar-nim-buadh or the Well of Virtues in St. Kilda. Deafness was also
cured by it. At the entrance to Munlochy Bay, in the Black Isle of
Cromarty, is a cave known in the neighbourhood as Craig-a-Chow,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Rock of Echo. Tradition says that in this cave a giant
once lived. If not the retreat of a giant, it was, at any rate, of
smugglers. What specially concerns us is that it contains a dripping
well, formerly much in request. Its water is particularly cold. Like
the St. Kilda spring, it was believed to remove deafness. Of
Whooping-cough Wells, a noted one was at Straid, in Muthill parish,
Perthshire. Invalids came to it from considerable distances. Early in
the present century a family travelled from Edinburgh to seek its aid.
The water was drunk immediately after sunset or before sunrise, and a
horn from a live ox had to convey it to the patient&rsquo;s lips. This
was not an uncommon practice. Perhaps it may have been due to some
vague notion, that life from the animal, whence the horn came, would be
handed on, <i>via</i> the spoon and the water, to the invalid. The
Straid horn was kept by a woman in the immediate <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1639" title="Source: neighburhood">neighbourhood</span>, who
acted as a sort of priestess of the well. A well at the Burn of Oxhill,
in the parish of Rathven, Banffshire, had a local celebrity for the
cure of the same complaint. Sufferers from gout tried the efficacy of a
spring in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>Eckford parish, Roxburghshire, styled Holy Well
or Priest&rsquo;s Well. A spring in the churchyard of Logiepert parish,
Forfarshire, removed sores, and another in Martin&rsquo;s Den, in the
same parish, was reckoned anti-scorbutic. Another noted Forfarshire
spring was in Kirkden parish, with the reputation of curing swellings
of the feet and legs. Lochinbreck Loch, in Balmaghie parish,
Kirkcudbrightshire, was visited from time immemorial for the cure of
ague. Indeed, there was hardly a bodily ailment that could not be
relieved by the water of some consecrated spring.</p>
<p>Springs were sometimes believed to cure female barrenness. Wives,
anxious to become mothers, formerly visited such wells as those of St.
Fillan at Comrie, and of St. Mary at Whitekirk, and in the Isle of May.
In this connection, Mr. J. R. Walker, in his article in the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; volume v. (new series), observes, &ldquo;Many of
the wells dedicated to &lsquo;Our Lady,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, St. Mary
(Virgin Mary) and to St. Brigid, the Mary of Ireland, were famous for
the cure of female sterility, which, in the days when a man&rsquo;s
power and influence in the land depended on the number of his clan or
tribe, was looked upon as a token of the divine displeasure, and was
viewed by the unfortunate spouses with anxious apprehension, dread,
doubt, jealousy, and pain. Prayer and supplication were obviously the
methods pursued by the devout for obtaining the coveted gift of
fertility, looked upon, by females especially, as the most <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>valuable of heavenly dispensations; and making
pilgrimages to wells under the patronage of the Mother of our Lord
would naturally be one of the most common expedients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epilepsy, with its convulsions and cries, seldom fails to arrest
attention and call forth sympathy. In times less enlightened than our
own, the disease was regarded with awe as of supernatural origin; and
remedies, always curious and sometimes revolting, were tried in order
to bring relief. We may assume that the water of consecrated springs
was used for this purpose; but, as far as we know, no Scottish fountain
was systematically visited by epileptic patients. After enumerating a
variety of folk-cures for the disease in question, Sir Arthur Mitchell,
in an article on Highland Superstitions bearing on Lunacy in the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; volume iv., remarks, &ldquo;For the cure of the
same disease, there is still practised in the North of Scotland a
formal sacrifice&mdash;not an oblique but a literal and downright
sacrifice&mdash;to a nameless but secretly acknowledged power, whose
propitiation is desired. On the spot where the epileptic first falls a
black cock is buried alive, along with a lock of the patient&rsquo;s
hair and some parings of his nails. I have seen at least three
epileptic idiots for whom this is said to have been done.&rdquo; The
same writer adds, &ldquo;Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;, of N&mdash;&mdash;,
informs me that some time ago he was called on to visit a poor man
belonging to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span>fishing population who had suddenly died,
and who had been subject to epileptic seizures. His friends told the
doctor that at least they had the comfort of knowing that everything
had been done for him which could have been done. On asking what
remedies they had tried, he was told that, among other things, a cock
had been buried alive below his bed, and the spot was pointed
out.&rdquo; This sacrifice of a cock in Scotland is of special
significance, for it formed a distinctive feature of the ritual once in
vogue in Wales at the village of Llandegla, Denbighshire. St.
Tegla&rsquo;s Well there, was believed to possess peculiar virtue in
curing epilepsy. Pennant gives a minute account of the ceremony as
practised in his days. The following is a summary:&mdash;&ldquo;About
two hundred yards from the church rises a small spring. The patient
washes his limbs in the well, makes an offering into it of fourpence,
walks round it three times, and thrice repeats the &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer.&rsquo; These ceremonies are never begun till after sunset. If
the afflicted be of the male sex, he makes an offering of a cock; if of
the fair sex, a hen. The fowl is carried in a basket, first round the
well, after that into the churchyard, when the same orisons and the
same circumambulations are performed round the church. The votary then
enters the church, gets under the communion table, lies down with the
Bible under his or her head, is covered with the carpet or cloth, and
rests there till break of day, departing after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>offering sixpence, and leaving the fowl in the
church. If the bird dies, the cure is supposed to have been effected,
and the disease transferred to the devoted victim.&rdquo; As regards
the cock or hen, the ceremony in this case was quite as much a
sacrifice as in the Scottish example. St. Tegla merely took the place
of the pagan divinity who had been first in the field, and to whom
offerings had been made. In former times, sacrificing a living animal
was also resorted to occasionally to cure disease in cattle. An ox was
buried alive in a pit, and the pit having been filled with earth, the
other members of the herd were made to walk over the spot. In 1629,
Isabel Young, spouse to George Smith, portioner of East Barnes,
Haddingtonshire, was tried for witchcraft. From her indictment we learn
that she was accused, <i>inter alia</i>, of having buried a
&ldquo;quick ox, with a cat and a quantity of salt,&rdquo; in a pit as
a sacrifice to the devil, the truth being that a live ox had been so
treated by her husband as a charm to cure his cattle, which were
diseased. A remarkable circumstance bearing on this point is alluded to
by Mr. A. W. Moore in his &ldquo;<i>Surnames and Place-names of the
Isle of Man</i>,&rdquo; under the heading of Cabbal-yn-Oural-Losht,
<i>i.e.</i>, Chapel of the Burnt Sacrifice. &ldquo;This name,&rdquo; he
tells us, &ldquo;records a circumstance which took place in the
nineteenth century, but which, it is to be hoped, was never customary
in the Isle of Man. A farmer, who had lost a number of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>sheep and cattle by murrain, burnt a calf as a
propitiatory offering to the Deity on this spot, where a chapel was
afterwards built. Such facts point to the same notion as that already
indicated in connection with St. Tegla&rsquo;s Well, viz., that disease
is due to some malignant being, whose favour is to be sought by the
offering up of a living creature.</p>
<p>In no department of medical science have methods of treatment
changed more within recent years than in that of insanity. Enlightened
views on the subject now prevail among the educated classes of society;
and the old notion that a maniac can be restored to mental health by
treating him like a criminal, or by administering a few shocks to his
already excited nerves, is fortunately a thing of the past. At least it
no longer holds sway in our lunatic asylums. In the minds of the
ignorant and credulous, however, the old leaven still works. Lady
Wilde, in her &ldquo;<i>Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages of
Ireland</i>,&rdquo; alludes to a method of treatment in fashion till
lately among the peasantry there. When anyone showed signs of insanity
&lsquo;a witch-doctor&rsquo; was called in. This potent individual
sprinkled holy water about the room and over the patient; and after
uttering certain incantations&mdash;understood by the by-standers to be
&lsquo;Latin prayers&rsquo;&mdash;proceeded to beat him with a stout
cudgel. In the end the ravings of the lunatic ceased, or as it was put,
&ldquo;the devil was driven out of him.&rdquo; In Cornwall, at St.
Nun&rsquo;s Well, the expulsive power of a new terror used to be tried.
According to Carew, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>the <i>modus operandi</i> was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The water running from St. Nun&rsquo;s Well fell
into a square and enclosed walled plat, which might be filled at what
depth they listed. Upon this wall was the frantic person put to stand,
his back towards the pool, and from thence, with a sudden blow in the
breast, tumbled headlong into the pond; where a strong fellow, provided
for the nonce, took him and tossed him up and down, alongst and athwart
the water, till the patient, by foregoing his strength, had somewhat
forgot his fury. Then was he conveyed to the church, and certain masses
said over him, upon which handling, if his right wits returned, St. Nun
had the thanks; but if there appeared small amendment, he was bowsened
again and again, while there remained in him any hope of life or
recovery.&rdquo; North of the Tweed the treatment was hardly less
soothing. When a lunatic was being rowed over to Innis Maree to drink
the water of St. Maelrubha&rsquo;s Well there, he was jerked out of the
boat by the friends who accompanied him. A rope had previously been
tied round his waist, and by this he was pulled back into the boat; but
before he could gather together his all-too-scattered wits, he was in
the water again. As a rule this was done, not once or twice, but
repeatedly, and in the case of both sexes. Such was the method up to a
comparatively recent date. Pennant thus describes what was done in
1772:&mdash;&ldquo;The patient is brought into the sacred island; is
made to kneel before the altar, viz., the stump of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>tree&mdash;where his attendants leave an
offering in money; he is then brought to the well and sips some of the
holy water; a second offering is made; that done, he is thrice dipped
in the lake; and the same operation is repeated every day for some
weeks.&rdquo; This towing after a boat to cure insanity was not an
isolated instance. Early in the present century, the wife of a man
living at Stromness in Orkney, went mad through the incantations of
another female believed to be a witch. The man bethought him of the
cure in question, and, out of love for his afflicted wife, dragged her
several times up and down the harbour behind his boat. Mr. R. M.
Fergusson, who mentions this case in his &ldquo;<i>Rambles in the Far
North</i>,&rdquo; says that the woman &ldquo;bobbed about behind the
boat like a cork, and remained as mad as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The well at Struthill, in Muthill parish, Perthshire, once had a
considerable reputation for the cure of insanity. It was customary to
tie patients at night to a stone near the spring, and recovery would
follow if they were found loose in the morning. An adjoining chapel was
ordered to be demolished in 1650 by the Presbytery of Auchterarder, on
the ground of its being the scene of certain superstitious rites, but
the spring continued to be visited till a much later date. At
Teampull-m&ograve;r in Lewis, in addition to walking round the ruins,
and being sprinkled with water from St. Ronan&rsquo;s Well, the insane
person was bound and left all night in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>chapel on the site of the altar. If he slept, he
would recover; but if he remained awake, there was no hope of a cure.
In the Struthill and Teampull-m&ograve;r instances, as well as that of
Strathfillan mentioned below, the binding of the patient was an
essential part of the treatment; and in two at least of the cases the
loosening of the bonds was reckoned an omen of good. The mysterious
loosening of bonds used to be an article of common belief. Dalyell, in
his &ldquo;<i>Darker Superstitions of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; remarks,
&ldquo;Animals were sometimes liberated supernaturally. In the Isle of
Enhallow, a horse tied up at sunset would wander about through the
night; and while the kirk session took cognisance of a suspected witch
who had exercised her faculties on a cow, the animal, though firmly
secured, was found to be free, and in their vicinity when the
investigation closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Holy Pool of St. Fillan was famous for the cure of various
diseases, but specially of insanity. It is referred to in
&ldquo;<i>Marmion</i>&rdquo; as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e1085">&ldquo;St. Fillan&rsquo;s blessed well</p>
<p class="line">Whose springs can frenzied dreams dispel</p>
<p class="line">And the craz&rsquo;d brain restore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is not, however, a well, but a pool, in the river
Fillan, about two miles lower down than Tyndrum. To correctly estimate
the reverence paid to this sacred pool, we must glance at the
influence, exerted by Fillan on the district during his life-time, and
afterwards by means<a id="xd26e1712" name="xd26e1712"></a> of his
relics. The saint flourished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>in the early eighth century. He
was born in Ireland. His father was Ferodach, and his mother was
Kentigerna, daughter of a prince of Leinster. She afterwards came to
Scotland and led the life of a recluse, on Inch Cailleach, an island in
Loch Lomond. According to the Aberdeen Breviary, Fillan was born with a
stone in his mouth, and was at once thrown into a lake where he was
ministered to by angels for a year. He was then taken out and baptised
by Bishop Ybarus, and at a later date received the monastic habit from
Muna, otherwise called Mundus. Devoting himself to solitary meditation
he built a cell close to Muna&rsquo;s monastery. On one occasion, a
servant went to call him to supper, and looking through a chink in the
wall, saw the saint busy writing, his uplifted left hand throwing light
over the book in lieu of a candle. Whatever may be thought of the
incident, few will deny its picturesqueness. In competent hands it
might be made the subject of a striking picture. Fillan afterwards went
to Lochalsh, where he dedicated a church to his uncle Congan, the
founder of the monastery of Turriff, in Aberdeenshire. We next find
Fillan in the principal scene of his missionary work, viz., in
Glendochart, in that portion of the glen anciently called Siracht, and
now Strathfillan. This area formed a separate parish till 1617, but was
then united to the parish of Killin. Fillan arrived with seven serving
clerics, and tradition says that he built his church at a spot<a id=
"xd26e1716" name="xd26e1716"></a> miraculously pointed out to him. The
neighbourhood was, and is full of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>interest.
&ldquo;Glendochart,&rdquo; writes Mr. Charles Stewart in &ldquo;<i>An
Gaidheal</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;is not celebrated for terrific mountain
scenery like Glencoe or the Coolins, but has a grandeur of a different
character. Lofty mountains, clothed, here in heather, there in green;
cloudy shadows frequently flitting across their sides, and serried
ridges of multiplied lines and forms of varied beauty, and along their
sides strangely shaped stones and boulders of rocks deposited by the
ancient glaciers. Along the strath there are stretches of water, its
course broken occasionally by lochs; sometimes wending its way slowly
and solemnly through green meadows, and anon rushing along as at the
celebrated bridge of Dochart, at Killin, with fire and fury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same writer mentions that three spots, where Fillan was wont to
teach the natives of the Strath, are still pointed out, viz., at the
upper end of Glendochart, where the priory was afterwards built,
halfway down the glen at Dun-ribin, and at the lower end at
Cnoc-a-bheannachd, <i>i.e.</i>, Hill of the Blessing, near Killin.
Fillan instructed the people in agriculture, and built mills for
grinding corn. Out of compliment to him, the mill at Killin was idle on
his festival, (Jan. 9th), as late as the middle of the present century.
Indeed there was a superstition in the district that it would not be
lucky to have it working on that day. Fillan also instituted fairs for
the sale and barter of local produce. His fair is still held at Killin
in January. The miraculous element in his history did not end
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>with his life. He seems to have died somewhere
about Lochearn, and his body was brought back to Glendochart, by way of
Glen Ogle. When the bearers reached the point where Glendochart opens
upwards and downwards, a dispute arose as to the destination of their
burden. Some wished the saint&rsquo;s body to be buried at Killin and
others at Strathfillan. Behold a marvel! When they could not agree,
they found that instead of one coffin there were two, and so each party
was satisfied.</p>
<p>Robert Bruce&rsquo;s fight with the followers of Macdougall of Lorne
took place near St. Fillan&rsquo;s Church, at a spot, afterwards named
Dalrigh or the King&rsquo;s Field. On that occasion, an earnest prayer
was addressed to the saint of the district, and through his
intercession victory came to Bruce. So at least runs the legend. After
his success at Bannockburn, the King in gratitude founded St.
Fillan&rsquo;s Priory, in Strathfillan, and endowed it with the
neighbouring lands of Auchtertyre, and with the sheep-grazing of
Bein-mhannach or the Monk&rsquo;s Mountain, in Glenlyon. Indeed, if
tradition speaks truth, Bruce had a double reason to be grateful to
Fillan, for the victory at Bannockburn, was attributed to the presence
in the Scottish camp, of a relic of the saint, said to be an arm-bone
set in silver. The relic, however, as Dr. John Stuart shows, in the
twelfth volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; was probably his Coig-gerach or
pastoral staff, popularly, but erroneously called his Quigrich.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>It is said to have been kept at Auchlyne, in a
chapel called Caipal-na-Faraichd, and when the chapel was burnt to have
been rescued by a person, either then, or afterwards, called Doire or
Dewar, whose descendants became its custodiers. The subsequent history
of the relic is curious. In 1782 it was at Killin in the keeping of
Malice Doire. In 1818 it was taken to Canada, where it remained for
some sixty years. Through the patriotic zeal of Sir Daniel Wilson it
was then sent back to Scotland, and now forms one of the treasures in
the National Museum of Antiquities, at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The sanctity of Fillan thus distilled like a fertilising dew over
the district of Glendochart. We need not, therefore, be surprised that,
in days darker than our own, a thriving crop of superstitions was the
result. It is certainly a striking testimony to the enduring influence
of the saint, that the pool, believed to have been blessed by him,
retained its fame till within the memory of persons still living.
Possibly the pool was reverenced even before his time. Towards the end
of last century, as many as two hundred persons were brought annually
to the spot. The time selected was usually the first day of the
quarter, (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>), and the immersion took
place after sunset. The patients, with a rope tied round their waist,
were thrown from the bank into the river. This was usually done thrice.
According to previous instructions, they picked up nine stones from the
bottom of the stream. After their dip they walked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>three times round three cairns in the immediate
neighbourhood, and at each turn added a stone to the cairn. An English
antiquary, who visited the spot in 1798, writes, &ldquo;If it is for
any bodily pain, fractured limb or sore, that they are bathing, they
throw upon one of these cairns that part of their clothing which
covered the part affected; also, if they have at home any beast that is
diseased, they have only to bring some of the meal which it feeds upon
and make it into paste with these waters, and afterwards give it to him
to eat, which will prove an infallible cure; but they must likewise
throw upon the cairn the rope or halter with which he was led.
Consequently the cairns are covered with old halters, gloves, shoes,
bonnets, nightcaps, rags of all sorts, kilts, petticoats, garters, and
smocks. Sometimes they go as far as to throw away their
halfpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the ceremony at the cairns the patient was led to the ruins of
St. Fillan&rsquo;s Chapel, about half a mile away, and there tied to a
stone with a hollow in it, large enough to receive the body, the
unfortunate person being fastened down to a wooden framework. The
patient was then covered with hay, and left in this condition all
night. As at Struthill, if the bonds were found loose in the morning,
he or she would recover; but if not, the case was counted hopeless, or
at least doubtful. As the writer of the article on the parish, in the
&ldquo;<i>New Statistical Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; shrewdly
observes, &ldquo;The prospect of the ceremony, especially in a cold
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>winter evening, might be a good test for persons
pretending insanity.&rdquo; At the time when he wrote, viz., in 1843,
the natives of the parish had ceased to believe in the efficacy of the
holy pool, but it was still visited by invalids from a distance. It was
usual, after the fastening process already described, to place St.
Fillan&rsquo;s bell on the head of the patient by way of helping on the
cure. This bell is quadrangular in shape. Its size and appearance are
thus described by Dr. Joseph Anderson in his &ldquo;<i>Scotland in
Early Christian Times</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;It is an elegant casting of
bronze, stands twelve inches high and measures nine by six inches wide
at the mouth. The ends are flat, the sides bulging, the top rounded. In
the middle of the top is the loop-like handle, terminating where it
joins the bell in two dragonesque heads with open mouths.&rdquo; The
bell weighs eight pounds fourteen ounces. In the fifteenth century the
relic seems to have been held in special honour, for it graced the
coronation of James IV. in 1488. After the Reformation, it was locked
up for some time, to prevent its use for the superstitious purpose
alluded to above. But, as a rule, it lay on a tombstone in the Priory
graveyard, protected only by the reverence paid to it in the district.
There was a belief that, if carried off, it would return of its own
accord, ringing all the way. In 1798 this belief was put to a severe
test, for in that year the English antiquary, already quoted, removed
the relic. &ldquo;In order,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to ascertain the
truth or <span class="corr" id="xd26e1754" title=
"Source: falsehold">falsehood</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>of the ridiculous
story of St. Fillan&rsquo;s bell, I carried it off with me, and mean to
convey it, if possible, to England. An old woman, who observed what I
was about, asked me what I wanted with the bell, and I told her that I
had an unfortunate relation at home out of his mind, and that I wanted
to have him cured. &lsquo;Oh, but,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;you must
bring him here to be cured, or it will be of no use.&rsquo; Upon which
I told her he was too ill to be moved, and off I galloped with the bell
back to Tyndrum Inn.&rdquo; The bell was taken to England. About
seventy years later, its whereabouts was discovered, and it was sent
back to Scotland. Like the crozier of the same saint, it is now in the
Antiquarian Museum at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>If we may believe a local tradition, the Holy Pool lost its
miraculous virtue in the following manner, though, after what the
English antiquary mentioned about its water being mixed with meal, and
given to diseased cattle, we see no reason why it should have been so
particular. A farmer who had a mad bull thought that, if the sacred
water could heal human ills, it would be efficacious also in the case
of the lower animals. So he plunged his infuriated beast into the
stream. What was the effect on the bull we do not know: but since then
the virtue has departed from the water. Except for a pleasure dip on a
hot summer&rsquo;s day, no one need now apply at the Holy Pool.</p>
<p>The unbroken reputation of such health resorts, for centuries, is
certainly remarkable. Strathfillan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>kept up its fame for over a
thousand years. At Gheel, in Belgium, for fully twelve hundred years,
successive generations of lunatics sought relief at St. Dympna&rsquo;s
Well. We must not be too hard on the ages before our own; for, though
in some respects dark, in other respects they had a good deal of light.
Nevertheless, severe things might be said about them. From a
present-day point of view, it might be argued that those, who took
their insane friends to get cured in the manner described, required,
like the patients themselves, a little rearrangement of their wits.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The epithet <i>wonderful</i> may fitly be applied to
whatever springs are endowed by popular credulity with mysterious
properties. Those already considered have been mainly associated with
the removal or prevention of disease. It is now proposed to glance at
certain other characteristics.</p>
<p>Some springs are wonderful as to their origin. Who does not know the
legend connected with Tre Fontane, in the vicinity of Rome, where water
bubbled up at the three places touched by St. Paul&rsquo;s severed
head? We do not recollect any Scottish instance of a well coming into
being in this way; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span>but in England we have St. Osyth&rsquo;s
Well in Essex, where that saint was beheaded by the Danes, and in
Wales, St. Winifred&rsquo;s Well in Flintshire. Concerning the latter,
Chambers, in his &ldquo;<i>Book of Days</i>,&rdquo; thus
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Winifred was a noble British maiden of the seventh
century; a certain Prince Cradocus fell in love with her, and, finding
his rough advances repulsed, cut off the lady&rsquo;s head. Immediately
after doing this, the prince was struck dead, and the earth, opening,
swallowed up his body. Meanwhile, Winifred&rsquo;s head rolled down the
hill; where it stopped, a spring gushed forth&mdash;the blood from the
head colouring the pebbles over which it flowed, and rendering fragrant
the moss growing around.&rdquo; Sweden has its St. Eric&rsquo;s Spring
at Upsala, marking the place where Eric, the king, was beheaded about
the middle of the twelfth century. St. Oswald&rsquo;s Well at Winwick,
in Lancashire, is said to indicate the spot where that famous
Northumbrian king received his death-wound when fighting against Penda,
the pagan ruler of Mercia. On a hill in Hertfordshire, a fountain arose
to quench the thirst of Alban, England&rsquo;s proto-martyr, who
suffered there about 300 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> According to a
Kincardineshire tradition, a spring in Dunnottar Castle miraculously
appeared for behoof of the Covenanters, who were confined there in
1685. In Holywood parish, Dumfriesshire, (so called from its oak
forest, sacred even in pre-Christian times), a fountain sprang up at
the intercession of Vynning, the patron of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>well
at Kilwinning, in Ayrshire. In Scottish hagiology, fountains usually
gush forth to supply water for baptism. In English legends they spring
up as a tribute to spots where the corpses of saintly persons have
rested. Thus, water issued from the graves of Ethelbert at Marden, in
Herefordshire, and of Withburga at East Dereham, in Norfolk, and also
from that of Frideswide at Oxford. St. Frideswide&rsquo;s Fair at the
last-mentioned place was a noted holiday in the middle ages. It lasted
a week, and, during its continuance, the keys of the city were in the
keeping of the prior, having been handed over by the mayor, who ceased
for the time to be responsible for the peace of the burgh. At
Trondhjem, in Norway, a spring arose to mark the spot where King Olaf
was buried, about the middle of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>Cuthbert was greatly honoured by the gushing forth of springs, both
during his lifetime and after his death. While at Lindisfarne, he was
seized with a desire for still greater retirement, and accordingly
withdrew to Farne Island, one of the Fern group, two miles distant from
Bamborough, and six from Lindisfarne. This island was then haunted by
evil spirits; but these he drove away, as Guthlac did from the marshes
of Crowland, in Lincolnshire. Cuthbert set about building a cell in
Farne Island, and, with the help of angels, the work was satisfactorily
completed. Unfortunately, there was no fresh water to be had; but the
want was soon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>supplied. In response to the saint&rsquo;s
prayers, a spring arose in the floor of his cell. Bede says,
&ldquo;This water, by a most remarkable quality, never overflowed its
first limits, so as to flood the floor, nor yet ever failed, however
much of it might be taken out; so that it never exceeded or fell short
of the daily wants of him who used it for his sustenance.&rdquo; The
miracle did not end here. When Eistan of Norway was ravaging the coast
of Northumberland in the twelfth century, he landed on Farne Island and
destroyed the property of the hermits, whose retreat it then was. The
spring, unwilling to give help to the robber bands, dried up. Thirst,
accordingly, compelled them to quit the island. No sooner had they left
than the spring reappeared and gladdened the spot once more. After
Cuthbert&rsquo;s death, his body was carried from place to place for
safety. In his &ldquo;<i>History of St. Cuthbert</i>,&rdquo; Archbishop
Eyre remarks, &ldquo;There is a legendary tradition, that when the
bearers of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s body journeyed northwards from
Yorkshire and came to Butterby, near Croxdale, they set down the coffin
on the right bank before crossing the river, and immediately a saline
spring burst out upon the spot. After fording the river they again
rested the coffin, and a spring of chalybeate water rose up where they
had laid down the body. A third time the weary travellers, struggling
up the rugged pass, were compelled to lay their precious burden on the
ground, and a sweet stream of water <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>gushed out of the
rock to refresh them.&rdquo; Prior to this, Cuthbert&rsquo;s relics had
rested a while at Melrose. Tradition says that, on resuming their
wanderings, they floated down the Tweed in a stone coffin as far as
Tillmouth, on the English Border. The fragments of a sarcophagus, said
to be the coffin in question, are still to be seen there beside the
ruins of St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s Chapel. This incident is thus referred to
in &ldquo;<i>Marmion</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Seven years Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s corpse they

<p class="line xd26e725">They rested them in fair Melrose:</p>

</div>
<p class="first">A Shropshire legend narrates that, on one occasion,
Milburga, who is still remembered in the name of Stoke St. Milborough,
was riding in all haste to escape from certain enemies. She fell at
length exhausted from her horse; but, at her command, the animal struck
a stone with his hoof, and water gushed out for her refreshment. In a
neighbouring field some men were sowing grain, and the saint prophesied
that in the evening they would gather the ripe corn. She instructed
them to tell her enemies, on their arrival, that she had passed when
the crop was being sown. The miracle duly happened, and
Milburga&rsquo;s foes were disconcerted in consequence. Shropshire and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>Yorkshire have strange traditions about the
sudden appearance of lakes, sometimes overwhelming human dwellings. In
the latter case, the tops of houses are said to be visible through the
water. Additional picturesqueness is occasionally given, by the
introduction into the story of vanished bells, sending forth from the
depths their soft cadences. At Tunstall, in Norfolk, a boggy piece of
ground, locally known as Hell-Hole, is marked by frequently rising
bubbles. The devil once carried off the bells of the church, and, when
pursued, plunged into the marsh. The bubbles are due to the bells
sinking lower and lower into the abyss. Such beliefs about lakes form
an interesting supplement to Scottish superstitions.</p>
<p>When Henry VI. was in hiding in Bolton Hall, in Yorkshire, he wished
to have a bath in the hot summer weather. His host, anxious to supply
what was lacking to the comfort of the royal fugitive, used a hazel
twig in his garden, in the hope of discovering water. The indications
being favourable, a well was dug, and the king was enabled to cool
himself to his heart&rsquo;s content. The spring still bears the
king&rsquo;s name. Michael Scott, who was born in Fife in the
thirteenth century, and was regarded by his contemporaries as a dabbler
in the black art, had a pupil in the north of England who undertook a
marvellous feat, viz., to bring the sea up the Wansbeck river to
Morpeth. Certain incantations were gone through, and the magician
started from the coast, followed by the tide. All went well till within
about five miles from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>the town, when he became alarmed
by the roaring of the water, and looked back. So the spell was broken,
and Morpeth remained inland. This recalls the story accounting for the
introduction of a good water-supply into Plymouth. When there was a
scarcity in the sixteenth century, Sir Francis Drake, the naval hero,
rode up to Dartmoor, and uttered some magical words over a spring
there. He immediately turned his horse and galloped back to the town,
followed by a copious stream.</p>
<p>Certain wells could put in a good claim to the title of
<i>wonderful</i> on the ground of the effects they were able to
produce. If a spring could act as a sign-post to guide the wayfarer,
who had strayed from his path, it might surely be classed among
marvels! This is what a certain well on Dartmoor, in Devonshire, could
do, at least in the sixteenth century. A man of the name of Fitz and
his wife, when crossing the moor in the year 1568, lost their way. They
lighted on the well in question, drank its water, and found the lost
track without the least difficulty. In gratitude, Fitz afterwards
raised a memorial of stone over the well &ldquo;for the benefit of all
pixy-led travellers.&rdquo; In Germany, before a meal, the ceremony of
wishing one&rsquo;s friend a good appetite is still kept up. Such a
salutation must have been unnecessary in the Island of Harris, at least
in Martin&rsquo;s time, for he tells us of a spring, then lately
discovered, that could produce an appetite whenever wanted. &ldquo;The
natives,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;find by experience that it is very
effectual for restoring lost appetite; all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>that
drink of it become very soon hungry though they have eat plentifully
but an hour before.&rdquo; A small quantity of its water might with
advantage be added to the contents of the &ldquo;loving cup&rdquo; at
the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s banquets, and on other festive occasions both
in, and out of the Metropolis. Martin speaks of another marvel in
Harris. &ldquo;A large cave in the face of a hill hath,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;two wells in it, one of which is excluded from dogs, for they
say that if a dog do but taste of the water, the well presently dryeth
up; and for this reason, all such as have occasion to lodge there take
care to tie their dogs that they may not have access to the water. The
other well is called the Dogs&rsquo; Well, and is only drunk by
them.&rdquo; The student of folklore cannot fail to find Martin a
congenial companion, as he records a variety of quaint Hebridean
customs that might have been passed over in silence by a more
matter-of-fact writer. When in the Island of Lewis, he was told of a
fountain at Loch Carloway &ldquo;that never whitened linen,&rdquo;
though the experiment had been often tried. In connection with his
visit to Barray, he says, &ldquo;The natives told me there is a well in
the village Tangstill, the water of which, being boiled, grows thick
like puddle. There is another well, not far from Tangstill, which, the
inhabitants say, in a fertile year, throws up many grains of barley in
July and August. And they say that the well of Kilbar throws up embryos
of cockles, but I could not discern any in the rivulet, the air being
at that time foggy.&rdquo; This reminds one of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>Well
in the Wall in Checkly parish, Staffordshire, said to throw out small
bones like those of chickens and sparrows all the year round except in
the months of July and August. Toubir-ni-Lechkin, in Jura, rising on a
hill near Tarbert, was a noted fountain. Martin mentions that its water
was counted &ldquo;lighter by one half&rdquo; than any other water in
the island, and that a great quantity of it might be drunk at one time
without causing inconvenience. He further says, &ldquo;The river Nissa
receives all the water that issues from this well, and this is the
reason they give why salmons here are in goodness and taste far above
those of any other river whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The power of some wells over the lower animals was remarkable. A
spring at Harpham, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, dedicated to St.
John of Beverley, was believed to subdue the fiercest animal. A raging
bull, when brought to it, became as gentle as a lamb. A spring of this
kind would indeed be a great boon in the country to timid, town-bred
tourists when crossing fields where there are cattle. To the margin of
such a spring they could retreat and there feel safe. Black Mere, at
Morridge, near Leek, in Staffordshire, was credited with the power of
frightening away animals. Cattle would not drink its water, and birds
would not fly over it. A mermaid was believed to dwell in its depths. A
reminiscence of this belief is to be found in the name of &ldquo;The
Mermaid,&rdquo; a wayside inn in the neighbourhood frequented by
sportsmen. Some wells <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>keep a sharp look-out on the use
made of their water. A certain spring at Gilsland, in Cumberland,
wished to dispense its favours freely, <i>i.e.</i>, without making the
public pay for them. The proprietor of the ground, however, resolved to
turn, what he counted, an honest penny, and built a house over the
spring for the sale of the water. The fountain, much aggrieved at this,
forthwith dried up. The house, not being required, was taken down, and
the benevolent water once more made its appearance.</p>
<p>Intermittent springs have been observed from an early date, and
strange notions have been formed about them. They are usually
associated in their ebbing and flowing with some particular river. In
some instances such a connection can be only imaginary, notably in the
case of the Keldgate Springs at Cottingham, in Yorkshire, thought to be
influenced by the river Derwent twenty miles away. An ebbing and
flowing well at the foot of Giggleswick Scar, near Settle, in the same
county, was represented by Michael Drayton under the poetic guise of a
nymph flying from the pursuit of an unwelcome lover. Gough, in his
edition of Camden&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Britannia</i>,&rdquo; of date 1806,
has the following about a spring near Paisley:&mdash;&ldquo;Bishop
Gibson says that in the lands of Newyards, near Paisley, is a spring
which ebbs and flows with the tide though far above any ground to which
the tide comes. Mr. Crawford, in his &lsquo;<i>History of the Shire of
Renfrew</i>,&rsquo; applies this to a spring in the lands of Woodside,
which is three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>miles from the Clyde, and half-a-mile from
Paisley bridge, and the ground much higher than the river.&rdquo; The
name of Dozmare Lake, in Cornwall, signifies in Cornish a drop of the
sea, the lake having been so called from a belief that it was tidal.
The absurdity of the belief is proved by the fact that the sheet of
water is eight hundred and ninety feet above the sea. The lake is said
to be unfathomable, and has for a haunting spirit a giant who is doomed
to empty it by means of a limpet shell.</p>
<p>A singular superstition is, or was till quite lately, cherished in
Peeblesshire, that Powbate Well, close to Eddlestone, completely fills
with its water the high hill on whose top it is situated. Chambers, in
his &ldquo;<i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; gives the
following particulars about the spring:&mdash;&ldquo;The mouth, called
Powbate E&rsquo;e, is covered over by a grate to prevent the sheep from
falling into it; and it is supposed that, if a willow wand is thrown
in, it will be found some time after, peeled at the water-laugh, a
small lake at the base of the hill supposed to communicate with
Powbate. Of course the hill is expected to break some day like a bottle
and do a great deal of mischief. A prophecy, said to be by Thomas the
Rhymer, and bearing evident marks of his style, is cited to support the
supposition:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Powbate, an ye break,</p>
<p class="line">Tak&rsquo; the Moorfoot in yere gate;</p>
<p class="line">Moorfoot and Mauldslie,</p>
<p class="line">Huntlycote, a&rsquo; three,</p>
<p class="line">Five kirks and an Abbacie!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>In explanation of this prophecy Chambers remarks: &ldquo;Moorfoot,
Mauldslie, and Huntlycote are farm-towns in the immediate neighbourhood
of the hill. The kirks are understood to have been those of Temple,
Carrington, Borthwick, Cockpen, and Dalkeith; and the abbacy was that
of Newbottle, the destruction of which, however, has been anticipated
by another enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scottish imagination, in attributing wonderful properties to
springs, has not gone the length of ascribing to any the power
possessed by St. Ludvan&rsquo;s Well in Cornwall. This fountain has
been already referred to as the giver of increased sight. But it had
the still more marvellous power of preventing any one baptised with its
water from being hanged by a hempen rope. Nor have we heard of any
spring north of the Tweed that could be a match for another Cornish
well, viz., that of St. Keyne, familiar to readers of Southey. Whoever,
after marriage, first drank of its water would be the ruler of the
house. On one occasion a bridegroom hurried to make sure of this right,
but was chagrined to find that he had been anticipated: his bride had
taken a bottleful of the water with her to church. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Am I likely to recover?&rdquo; is a question on
many a patient&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Ask your doctor;&rdquo; and if the
case looks serious, &ldquo;Have a consultation&rdquo; is the answer
nowadays. Formerly, the answer was &ldquo;Go to a consecrated
well,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Get some one else to go in your stead, and you
will get a reply.&rdquo; There is no reason to believe that
<i>every</i> sacred spring was credited with this power; but
<i>many</i> undoubtedly were. Hydromancy has been a favourite mode of
divination. &ldquo;The conscious water&rdquo; could predict the future,
and questions connected with health were laid before it for its
decision. The Greeks dipped a mirror into a well, and foretold health
or sickness from the appearance of the watery lines on its surface. A
pool in Laconia, sacred to Juno, revealed approaching good or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>evil fortune respectively, by the sinking or
floating of wheaten cakes thrown into it, and auguries were also drawn
from the movements of stones when dropt into it. Springs, therefore,
deserved the respect shown to them by the confiding public. Indeed they
not only told of recovery; they supplied the medicine required to
ensure it, and were thus doctors and druggists combined. Sometimes the
omen was unpropitious. In many cases the prophecy would work out its
own fulfilment. There was a well in the Island of Lewis that caused
either instant death or recovery to the patient who tested its virtues:
but a speedy fulfilment like this was exceptional. St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Well at Shadar, in Lewis, was much esteemed for its power of augury. A
tub, containing some of its water, was taken to the house of the
patient, and a small wooden dish was placed on the surface of the
water. If this dish turned sunways, it showed that the patient would
recover; but if in an opposite direction, that he would die. In
reference to this instance, Mr. Gomme, in his &ldquo;<i>Ethnology in
Folklore</i>,&rdquo; observes, &ldquo;I am inclined to connect this
with the vessel or cauldron so frequently occurring in Celtic
tradition, and which Mr. Nutt has marked as &lsquo;a part of the gear
of the oldest Celtic divinities&rsquo; perhaps of divinities older than
the Celts.&rdquo; On one occasion two parishioners of Fodderty, in
Ross-shire, consulted Tobar-na-domhnuich in that parish in behalf of a
sick friend. When they placed their pitcher on the surface of the
water, the vessel moved round from south to west, as in the last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>instance, and they hastened back to their friend
with the good news. This was in the year 1832. About the same time, a
woman brought her sick child to be bathed in the well, but was
surprised and not a little terrified to see a strange creature, with
glaring eyes, leap into it as she approached. Love for her child made
her brave. Overcoming her fear, she dislodged the creature, and bathed
the little invalid. In the end, however, she must have regarded the
appearance of the creature as a bad omen, for the child did not
recover. The usual way of consulting the spring in question was to draw
water from it before sunrise, and to convey the water to the
invalid&rsquo;s house. The patient was then immersed in it, and if it
remained clear the circumstance pointed to recovery; but if it assumed
a brownish colour, the illness would end in death. In former times a
shirt was thrown into St. Oswald&rsquo;s Well, in Yorkshire, by way of
augury. The floating of the shirt foretold returning health. The
sinking foretold death. When a portion of an invalid&rsquo;s clothing
was flung into the Dow Loch, in Dumfriesshire, the same rule held good.
As may be noticed, the augury in these two cases was the <i>reverse</i>
of that in the case of Juno&rsquo;s pool above alluded to.</p>
<p>There were other ways in which wells acted the prophet. If a certain
worm in a spring on the top of a particular hill in Strathdon was found
alive, the patient would recover. A well at Ardnacloich in Appin
contained a dead worm, if the patient&rsquo;s illness would prove
fatal; but a living one, if otherwise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>The Virgin&rsquo;s
Well, near the ancient church of Kilmorie on the shores of Loch Ryan in
Wigtownshire, had an ingenious way of predicting the future. If the
patient, on whose account the water was sought, would recover, the
fountain flowed freely; but if the malady would end in death, the water
refused to gush forth. Montluck Well, in the grounds of Logan in the
same county, got the credit of acting on a similar principle. When
speaking of this spring, Symson says, &ldquo;it is in the midst of a
little bog to which several persons have recourse to fetch water for
such as are sick, asserting (whether it be truth or falsehood I shall
not determine) that if the sick person shall recover, the water shall
so bubble and mount up when the messenger dips in his vessel, that he
will hardly get out dry shod by reason of the overflowing of the well;
but if the sick person be not to recover, there shall not be any such
overflowing in the least.&rdquo; We find a belief in the south-west of
England corresponding to this in the south-west of Scotland. Gulval
Well, in Fosses Moor there, was resorted to by persons anxious to know
the fate of absent friends. If the person inquired about was dead, the
water remained perfectly still; if sick, it bubbled, though in a muddy
fashion; but if well, it sent out a sparkling gush. Mr. Hunt mentions
the case of a woman, who, with her babe in her arm, consulted the
spring about her absent husband, under the guidance of an aged female
who acted as the guardian of the well. &ldquo;Obeying the old
woman&rsquo;s directions, she knelt on the mat of bright <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>green grass which grew around, and, leaning over
the well so as to see her face in the water, she repeated after her
instructor:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Water, water, tell me truly,</p>
<p class="line">Is the man I love truly</p>
<p class="line">On the earth, or under the sod,</p>
<p class="line">Sick or well,&mdash;in the name of God?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Some minutes passed in perfect silence, and anxiety
was rapidly turning cheeks and lips pale, when the colour rapidly
returned. There was a gush of clear water from below, bubble rapidly
followed bubble sparkling brightly in the morning sunshine. Full of
joy, the young mother rose from her knees, kissed her child, and
exclaimed, &lsquo;I am happy now!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; At Barenton in
Brittany is a spring still believed in by the peasantry. A pin is dropt
into the well, and if good fortune is in store, the water sends up
bubbles; but if not, it remains quite still. The quantity of water in
St. Maelrubha&rsquo;s Well on Innis-Maree varied from time to time.
When a patient was brought for treatment and there was a scanty supply,
the omen was considered unfavourable; but when the water was abundant,
the saint was deemed propitious, and the hope of recovery was
consequently great.</p>
<p>The fly at St. Michael&rsquo;s Well in Banffshire was looked upon as
a prophet. In the &ldquo;<i>Old Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; we read, that, &ldquo;if the sober matron wished to
know the issue of her husband&rsquo;s ailment, or the love-sick nymph
that of her languishing swain, they visited the Well of St. Michael.
Every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>movement of the sympathetic fly was regarded in
silent awe; and as he appeared cheerful or dejected, the anxious
votaries drew their presages.&rdquo; At Little Conan in Cornwall is a
spring, sacred to Our Lady of Nants. It was at one time resorted to on
Palm Sunday by persons anxious to know whether they would outlive the
year. A cross, made of palm, was thrown into the water. If it floated,
the thrower would survive the twelvemonth; but if it sank, he would die
within that time. Maidens used to visit Madron Well in the same county
on May morning to forecast their matrimonial fate. They took two pieces
of straw, about an inch in length, and placing them crosswise fastened
them together with a pin. The cross was then thrown into the spring.
The rising bubbles were carefully counted, for they corresponded in
number with the years that would elapse before the arrival of the
wedding-day.</p>
<p>Portents of death were sometimes furnished by lochs and springs. At
Harpham in Yorkshire there is a tradition that a drummer lad in the
fourteenth century was accidentally drowned in a certain spring by a
St. Quintin&mdash;Lord of the Manor. Ever afterwards the sound of a
drum was heard in the well on the evening before the death of one of
the St. Quintin family. Camden, in his &ldquo;<i>Britannia</i>,&rdquo;
tells of a sheet of water in Cheshire called Blackmere Lake, lying in
the district where the Brereton family had lands, and records the local
belief that, just before any heir of that house died, trunks of trees
were seen floating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>on its surface. Water occasionally gave
warning by turning red like blood. A certain fountain, near the Elbe,
in Germany, was at one time believed to do this, in view of an
approaching war. St. Tredwell&rsquo;s Loch, in Papa-Westray, Orkney,
has already been referred to, in connection with its habit of turning
red, whenever anything remarkable was about to happen to a member of
the Royal Family. When the Earl of Derwentwater was beheaded, in 1716,
the news spread that the stream flowing past his estate of Dilston Hall
in Northumberland ran with blood. The same was said of the river at
Bothel, in the parish of Topenhow, in Cumberland, on the occasion of
the execution of Charles I., in 1649. There was at one time a well in
Canterbury Cathedral. After the assassination of Thomas &agrave; Becket
the sweepings of his blood and brains from the floor were thrown into
it, and more than once afterwards the water turned red and effected
various miraculous cures. Lady Wilde, in her &ldquo;<i>Ancient Legends
of Ireland</i>,&rdquo; narrates how one of the holy wells of Erin lost
its efficacy for curing purposes through having been touched by a
murderer. The priest of the district took some of its water and
breathed on it thrice in the name of the Trinity, when, lo! a
mysterious change came over it, and it appeared red like blood! The
murderer was captured and handed over to justice, and the well once
more began to work cures.</p>
<p>Some springs seemed anxious to be behind the scenes (though before
the event) in connection with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147"
href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>various incidents in British
annals. A spring at Warlingham, in Surrey, rises before any great event
in our country&rsquo;s history. At any rate it did so before three
great events in the seventeenth century, viz., the Restoration, the
Plague, and the Revolution. The famous Drumming Well at Oundle, in
Northamptonshire, was also specially active in the seventeenth century.
By making a sound like the beating of a drum, it announced the approach
of a Scottish army, and gave warning of the death of Charles II. In the
same century a pool in North Tawton parish, Devonshire, even though dry
in summer, became full of water at the driest season before the death
of a prince, and remained so till the event happened. Two centuries
earlier a certain well at Langley Park, in Kent, had a singular way of
foretelling the future. In view of a battle it became dry, though rain
fell heavily. If there was to be no fighting, it appeared full of
water, even during the greatest drought. A spring at Kilbarry, in the
island of Barra, Outer Hebrides, served the same purpose, but its mode
of augury was different. In this case, as Dalyell records in his
&ldquo;<i>Darker Superstitions</i>,&rdquo; drops of blood appeared in
prospect of war; but little bits of peat, if peace was to remain
unbroken. Walcott mentions, in his
&ldquo;<i>Scoti-Monasticon</i>,&rdquo; that there was at Kilwinning, in
Ayrshire, &ldquo;a sacred fountain which flowed in 1184, and at other
times, before a war or trouble, with blood instead of water for eight
successive days and nights.&rdquo; When Marvel-sike <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>Spring, near Brampton Bridge, in
Northamptonshire, overflowed its customary limits, people used to
interpret its conduct as signifying approaching dearth, the death of
some great person, or some national disturbance. In these days, when so
keen an interest is taken in the proceedings of Parliament, it is a
pity that there is no spring in our land capable of announcing the
probable date of a dissolution. Such a spring would relieve the public
mind from much uncertainty, and would benefit the trade and commerce of
the country.</p>
<p>Heritable jurisdictions were abolished in Scotland soon after the
Stuart rising of 1745. This privilege, enjoyed till then by many
landowners north of the Tweed, was popularly known as the &ldquo;right
of pit and gallows,&rdquo; the pit being for the drowning of women and
the gallows for the hanging of men. In 1679, a certain woman, Janet
Grant by name, was convicted of theft in the baronial court of Sir
Robert Gordon of Gordonstone, held at Drainie, in Elginshire, and was
sentenced to be drowned in Spynie Loch. In this and other similar cases
water was used as a means of execution. In the case of witchcraft it
was called in as a witness in the trial. The criminal proceedings for
the detection and punishment of so-called witches form a painfully dark
chapter in Scottish history. As Mr. W. H. Davenport Adams pointedly
puts it, in his &ldquo;<i>Witch, Warlock, and Magician</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The common people for a time might have been divided into two
classes, &lsquo;witches and witchfinders.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The same
writer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>observes, &ldquo;Among the people of Scotland, a
more serious-minded and imaginative race than the English, the
superstition of witchcraft was deeply rooted at an early period. Its
development was encouraged not only by the idiosyncracies of the
national character, but also by the nature of the country and the
climate in which they lived. The lofty mountains, with their misty
summits and shadowy ravines, their deep obscure glens, were the fitting
homes of the wildest fancies, the eeriest legends, and the
storm&mdash;crashing through the forests, and the surf beating on the
rocky shore, suggested to the ear of the peasant or fisherman the
voices of unseen creatures&mdash;of the dread spirits of the waters and
the air.&rdquo; A favourite method of discovering whether an accused
person was guilty or not, was that technically known as
<i>pricking</i>. It was confidently believed that every witch had the
&ldquo;devil&rsquo;s mark&rdquo; somewhere on her person. The existence
of this mark could be determined: for if a pin was thrust into the
flesh with the result that neither blood came, nor pain was felt, the
spot so punctured was the mark in question. This showed, without doubt,
that the accused was guilty of the heinous crime laid to her charge.
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, in his &ldquo;<i>History of Witchcraft in
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; gives instances of the finding of the
&ldquo;devil&rsquo;s mark.&rdquo; He mentions the case of Janet Barker,
a servant in Edinburgh, who acknowledged that she possessed this
particular mark between her shoulders. A pin was stuck into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>the spot and remained there for an hour without
her being aware of its presence. Such, at least, was the way of stating
the case in 1643. With this simple test at command it is not easy to
understand why water should have been required to give evidence. But so
it was. Among various nations the water-ordeal has been in fashion. It
was specially popular in Scotland a couple of centuries ago. Part of
the bay at St. Andrews is still styled the Witches&rsquo; Lake,
recalling by its name the crude notions and cruel practices of our
ancestors. A pool in the Carron, near Dunnottar Church in
Kincardineshire, at one time served a similar purpose.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the sinking or the floating of an object thrown
into water in cases of sickness told of death or recovery. In like
manner innocence or guilt could be determined in the case of persons
accused of sorcery. If the person sank, she was innocent; but guilty,
if she floated. King James VI.&mdash;a great authority on the
subject&mdash;explains why this was so. In his
&ldquo;<i>Daemonologie</i>,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;As in a secret
murther, if the dead carcase be at any time thereafter handled by the
murtherer, it will gush out of blood, as if the blood were raging to
the Heaven for revenge of the murtherer (God having appointed that
secret supernatural sign for trial of that secret unnatural crime), so
that it appears that God hath appointed (for a supernatural sign of the
monstrous impiety of witches) that the water shall refuse to receive
them in her bosom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>that have shaken off them the sacred water
of baptism and wilfully refused the benefit thereof.&rdquo; The Abbey
of Scone, in Perthshire, founded by Alexander I., in 1114, received
from him a charter confirming the right of using the water-ordeal for
the detection of witchcraft. The place of trial was a small island in
the Tay, half-way between the abbey and the bridge of Perth. According
to the practices, common at such trials, the accused was thrown into
the water, wrapped up in a sheet, and having the thumbs and the great
toes fastened together. The chances of life were certainly not great
under the circumstances, for, if the poor creature floated, she had
soon to exchange water for fire. The stake was her goal. If she sank,
the likelihood was that she would be drowned. Bundled up in the manner
described, she was scarcely in a position to rescue herself; and the
bystanders were in no humour to give a helping hand. Close to the town
of Elgin was once a witch-pool, known as the Order Pot, so called from
its having been the place of ordeal. Through time it was filled up,
mainly with rubbish from the ruins of the cathedral, in fulfilment, it
was believed, of the prophecy of Thomas the Rhymer that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The Order Pot and Lossie grey</p>
<p class="line">Shall sweep the Chanonry kirk away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the seventeenth century a woman who was accused of
having brought disease on a certain man through her sorceries was
thrown into the pool. She sank, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>and the crowd, who had
collected to witness the trial, exclaimed, &ldquo;To Satan&rsquo;s
kingdom she hath gone.&rdquo; The incident is of interest since the
view of her case, then taken, was contrary to the one usually held, as
explained above. Perhaps the people standing by thought that the devil
was so eager to get his own, that he would not lose the chance of
securing his victim at once. Elginshire has another memorial of the
black art in the form of The Witch&rsquo;s Stone at Forres. It consists
of a boulder about a yard in diameter and probably marks the spot where
unhappy females convicted of witchcraft were executed. About the year
1790 some one wished to turn the stone to good account for building
purposes and broke it into three pieces. The breaker, however, was
compelled to put it together again, and the iron then used to clasp it
is still in position. Legend accounts for the breakage in a less
prosaic way. When the boulder was being carried by a witch through the
air in her apron, the apron-string broke, and, as a result, the stone
was broken too. The spot was formerly reckoned ill-omened. It would be
too much to say that belief in the black art has vanished from the
Highlands; though, fortunately for the good sense of our age, as well
as for those who live in it, witch pools are not now in requisition.
Pennant bears witness to the fact that belief in witchcraft ceased in
Perthshire soon after the repeal, in 1736, of the penal statutes
against witches. In more northern districts it continued a vital part
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>popular creed till much later. The Rev. Donald
Sage mentions, in his &ldquo;<i>Memorabilia Domestica</i>,&rdquo; that
the Rev. Mr. Fraser, minister of Killearnan in Ross-shire, about 1750,
was much troubled with somnolency even in the pulpit. He was in
consequence thought to be bewitched&mdash;a notion that he himself
shared. Two women were fixed on, as the cause of his unnatural
slumbers. It was believed that they had made a clay image representing
the minister and had stuck pins into it. Certain pains felt by him were
ascribed to this cause. Had it not been for the Act of 1736, it would
doubtless have fared ill with the supposed witches.</p>
<p>Witches, however, were not alone in their power of floating.
According to a popular belief in the north-west Highlands, insane
people cannot sink in water. Sir Arthur Mitchell, in the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; volume iv., refers to the case of a certain
madman&mdash;Wild Murdoch by name&mdash;concerning whom strange stories
were told. He was born on the small island of Melista, near the coast
of Lewis, used only for occasional habitation in connection with the
pasturing of cattle. Anyone born in the island is believed to become
insane. The superstition about not sinking was certainly put to a
severe test in Wild Murdoch&rsquo;s case. &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo;
remarks Sir Arthur, &ldquo;that his friends used to tie a rope round
his body, make it fast to the stern of the boat, and then pull out to
sea, taking the wretched man in tow. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>story goes that he
was so buoyant that he could not sink; &lsquo;that they tried to press
him down into the water;&rsquo; that he could swim with a stone
fastened to him; that when carried to the rocky holms of Melista or
Greinan, round which the open Atlantic surges, and left there alone, he
took to the water and swam ashore.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">&ldquo;One of the great charms of Highland landscape
is the gleam of still water that so often gives the element of repose
in a scene of broken cliff and tumbled crag, of noisy cascade and
driving cloud. No casual tourist can fail to notice what a wonderful
variety of lakes he meets with in the course of any traverse he may
take across the country. Among the higher mountains there is the little
tarn nestling in a dark sunless corry, and half-encircled with grim
snow-rifted crags. In the glen, there is the occasional broadening of
the river into a lake that narrows again to let the stream rush down a
rocky ravine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>In the wider strath there is the broad still
expanse of water, with its fringe of wood and its tree-covered islets.
In the gneiss region of the North-West, there is the little lochan
lying in its basin of bare rock and surrounded with scores of others
all equally treeless and desolate.&rdquo; So writes Professor Sir A.
Geikie in his &ldquo;<i>Scenery of Scotland</i>.&rdquo; His point of
view is that of a scientific observer, keenly alive to all the varied
phenomena of nature. But amid the scenes described lived men and women
who looked at the outer world through the refracting medium of
superstition. They saw the landscape, but they saw also what their own
imagination supplied. In Strathspey, is a sheet of water bearing the
Gaelic name of Loch-nan-Spoiradan or the Lake of Spirits. What shape
these spirits assumed we do not know, but there was no mistake about
the form of the spirit who guarded Lochan-nan-Deaan, close to the old
military road between Corgarff and Tomintoul. The appearance of this
spirit may be gathered from the Rev. Dr. Gregor&rsquo;s remarks in an
article on &ldquo;Guardian Spirits of Wells and Lochs&rdquo; in
&ldquo;<i>Folklore</i>&rdquo; for March, 1892. After describing the
loch, he says, &ldquo;It was believed to be bottomless, and to be the
abode of a water-spirit that delighted in human sacrifice.
Notwithstanding this blood-thirsty spirit, the men of Strathdon and
Corgarff resolved to try to draw the water from the loch, in hope of
finding the remains of those that had perished in it. On a fixed day a
number of them met with spades and picks to cut a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>way
for the outflow of the water through the road. When all were ready to
begin work, a terrific yell came from the loch, and there arose from
its waters a diminutive creature in shape of a man with a red cap on
his head. The men fled in terror, leaving their picks and spades behind
them. The spirit seized them and threw them into the loch. Then, with a
gesture of defiance at the fleeing men, and a roar that shook the
hills, he plunged into the loch and disappeared amidst the water that
boiled and heaved as red as blood.&rdquo; Near the boundary, between
the shires of Aberdeen and Banff, is a small sheet of water called
Lochan-wan, <i>i.e.</i>, Lamb&rsquo;s Loch. The district around is now
a deer forest, but at one time it was used for grazing sheep. The
tenants around had the privilege of pasturing a certain number of
sheep. Dr. Gregor says, &ldquo;Each one that sent sheep to this common
had to offer in sacrifice, to the spirit of the loch, the first lamb of
his flock dropped on the common. The omission of this sacrifice brought
disaster; for unless the sacrifice was made, half of his flock would be
drowned before the end of the grazing season.&rdquo; As in the case of
Lochan-nan-Deaan, an attempt was made to break the spell by draining
the loch, but this attempt, though less tragic in its result, was
equally unavailing. On three successive days a channel was made for the
outflow of the water, but each night the work was undone. A watch was
set, and at midnight of the third day hundreds of small black creatures
were seen to rise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>from the lake, each with a spade in his
hand. They set about filling up the trench and finished their work in a
few minutes. Mr. Charles Hardwick, in &ldquo;<i>Traditions,
Superstitions, and Folklore</i>,&rdquo; published in 1872, tells of a
folk-belief, prevalent in the North of England, particularly in
Lancashire. &ldquo;I remember well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;when very
young, being cautioned against approaching to the side of stagnant
pools of water partially covered with vegetation. At the time, I firmly
believed that if I disobeyed this instruction a certain water
&lsquo;boggart,&rsquo; named Jenny Greenteeth, would drag me beneath
her verdant screen and subject me to other tortures besides death by
drowning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poetry and superstition regard external nature from the same
standpoint, in as much as both think of it as animate. But there is a
difference. The one endows nature with human qualities, and knows that
it does so through the imagination; the other does the same, and
believes that there is no imagination in the matter. The work of the
former is well expressed by Dr. E. B. Tylor, when he observes,
&ldquo;In all that water does, the poet&rsquo;s fancy can discern its
personality of life. It gives fish to the fisher and crops to the
husbandman, it swells in fury and lays waste the land, it grips the
bather with chill and cramp and holds with inexorable grasp its
drowning victim.&rdquo; That rivers were monsters hungering, or
perhaps, one should say, thirsting, for human victims is a fact borne
witness to by poetry as well as by superstition. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>An
example of this occurs in the following popular rhyme connected with
the Scottish Border:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tweed said to Till,</p>
<p class="line">&lsquo;What gars ye rin sae still&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="line">Till said to Tweed,</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Bloodthirsty Dee</p>

</div>
<p class="first">According to folklore, there is no doubt that rivers
are &ldquo;uncanny.&rdquo; Beneath their rippling surface dwells a
being who keeps a lookout for the unwary traveller and seeks to draw
him into the dark depths. A belief in such a being is not always
explicitly avowed. But there are certain folk-practices undoubtedly
implying it. When anyone is drowned in a river, the natural way to find
the body is to drag the stream in the neighbourhood of the accident.
But superstition has recourse to another method. A loaf of bread, with
or without quicksilver in it, is placed on the surface of the water and
allowed to drift with the current. The place where the loaf becomes
stationary marks the spot where the body lies concealed. According to
another method, a boat is rowed up and down the stream, and a drum is
beat all the time. When the boat passes over the resting place of the
body the drum will cease to sound. This was done in Derbyshire
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>no longer ago than 1882, in order to find the
corpse of a young woman who had fallen into the Derwent. In such
practices there is a virtual recognition of a water-spirit who can, by
certain rites, be compelled to give up his prey, or at any rate to
disclose the whereabouts of the victim. A Deeside tradition supplies a
good illustration of this. A man called Farquharson-na-Cat,
<i>i.e.</i>, Farquharson of the Wand, so named from his trade of
basketmaking, had on one occasion to cross the river just above the
famous linn. It was night. He lost his footing, was swept down into the
linn, and there drowned. Search was made for his body, but in vain. His
wife, taking her husband&rsquo;s plaid, knelt down on the river&rsquo;s
brink, and prayed to the water-spirit to give her back her dead. She
then threw the plaid into the stream. Next morning her husband&rsquo;s
corpse, with the plaid wrapped round it, was found lying on the edge of
the pool. Till quite lately, fishing on the Tweed was believed to be
influenced by the fairies of the river. Salt was thrown into the water,
and sprinkled on the nets to insure a plentiful catch of fish. This was
really the offering of a sacrifice to the river-spirits.</p>
<p>Frequently the guardian of the flood appeared in distinctly human
shape. An excellent example of this is to be found in Hugh
Miller&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>My Schools and Schoolmasters</i>,&rdquo; where
a picturesque description is given of the spirit haunting the Conan.
Hugh Miller was an expert swimmer, and delighted to bathe in the pools
of that Ross-shire stream. &ldquo;Its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>goblin or
water-wraith,<span class="corr" id="xd26e2076" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> he tells us, &ldquo;used to appear as a
tall woman dressed in green, but distinguished chiefly by her withered,
meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl. I knew all the
various fords, always dangerous ones, where of old she used to start,
it was said, out of the river before the terrified traveller to point
at him as in derision with her skinny finger, or to beckon him
invitingly on; and I was shown the very tree to which a poor Highlander
had clung when, in crossing the river by night, he was seized by the
goblin, and from which, despite of his utmost exertions, though
assisted by a young lad, his companion, he was dragged into the middle
of the current, where he perished. And when in swimming at sunset over
some dark pool, where the eye failed to mark, or the foot to sound, the
distant bottom, the twig of some sunken bush or tree has struck against
me as I passed, I have felt, with sudden start, as if touched by the
cold, bloodless fingers of the goblin.&rdquo; At Pierse Bridge, in
Durham, the water-spirit of the Tees went by the name of Peg Powler,
and there were stories in the district, of naughty children having been
dragged by her into the river.</p>
<p>In the Highlands and Lowlands alike, the spirit inhabiting rivers
and lakes was commonly known as the water-kelpy. A south country ballad
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The side was steep, the bottom deep</p>
<p class="line">Frae bank to bank the water pouring;</p>

<p class="first">The kelpy corresponded in attributes with the
Icelandic Nikr; whence has come our term Old Nick, popularly applied to
the devil. A well-known picture by Sir Noel Paton has familiarised the
story of &ldquo;Nickar, the soulless,&rdquo; who is there represented
as a creature with frog-like feet, but with a certain human look about
him, crouching among sedge by the side of water, and playing his
ghittern&mdash;an instrument resembling a guitar. He appears, however,
more melancholy and less mischievous than the other members of his
fraternity. A kelpy that idled away his time with music and made no
attempt to drown anybody, was quite an exceptional being. In Sweden,
where Nikr was regarded with awe, ferry-men at specially dangerous
parts of rivers warned those who were crossing in their boat not even
to mention his name, lest some mishap should follow. In his
&ldquo;<i>Saxons in England</i>,&rdquo; Mr. J. M. Kemble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>thus
refers to other manifestations of the same creature:&mdash;&ldquo;The
beautiful Nix or Nixie who allures the young fisher or hunter to seek
her embraces in the wave which brings his death; the Neck who seizes
upon and drowns the maidens who sport upon his banks; the river-spirit
who still yearly, in some parts of Germany, demands tribute of human
life, are all forms of the ancient Nicor.&rdquo; The same writer
continues:&mdash;&ldquo;More pleasing is the Swedish Stromkarl, who,
from the jewelled bed of his river, watches with delight the children
gambol in the adjoining meadows, and singing sweetly to them in the
evening, detaches from his hoary hair the sweet blossoms of the
water-lily, which he wafts over the surface to their hands.&rdquo; In
his &ldquo;<i>Folklore of East Yorkshire</i>,&rdquo; Mr. J. B.
Nicholson alludes to a haunted pool between Bewholme and Atwick, at the
foot of the hill on which Atwick Church stands. This pool is shaded by
willows, and is believed to be haunted by a spirit known in the
district as the Halliwell Boggle. In connection with Robin Round Cap
Well, in the same district, Mr. Nicholson tells a story&mdash;found
also in the south of Scotland&mdash;of a certain house-spirit or
brownie, who proved so troublesome to the farmer whom he served that
his master resolved to remove to other quarters. The furniture was
accordingly put in carts and a start was made for the new home. On the
way, a friend accosted the farmer and asked if he was flitting. Before
he could reply, a voice came from the churn&mdash;&ldquo;Ay,
we&rsquo;re <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>flitting!&rdquo; and, behold, there sat Robin
Round Cap. The farmer, seeing that he could not thus rid himself of the
spirit, returned to his old home; but, afterwards, he succeeded in
charming the brownie into a well, where he still remains. The same
writer relates a superstition about a certain round hole near
Flamborough where a girl once committed suicide. &ldquo;It is
believed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that anyone bold enough to run nine
times round this place will see Jenny&rsquo;s spirit come out, dressed
in white; but no one has yet been bold enough to venture more than
eight times, for then Jenny&rsquo;s spirit called out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Ah&rsquo;ll tee on my bonnet</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">An&rsquo; put on me shoe,</p>
<p class="line">An&rsquo; if thoo&rsquo;s nut off</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">Ah&rsquo;ll seean catch thoo!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A farmer, some years ago, galloped round it on
horseback, and Jenny did come out, to the great terror of the farmer,
who put spurs to his horse and galloped off as fast as he could, the
spirit after him. Just on entering the village, the spirit, for some
reason unknown, declined to proceed further, but bit a piece clean out
of the horse&rsquo;s flank, and the old mare had a white patch there to
her dying day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;<i>Folklore Journal</i>&rdquo; for 1889, Dr. Gregor
relates some kelpy legends collected by him in Aberdeenshire. On one
occasion a man had to cross the Don by the bridge of Luib, Corgarff, to
get to his wife who was then very ill. When he reached the river, he
found that the bridge&mdash;a wooden one&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>had
been swept away by a flood. He despaired of reaching the other bank,
when a tall man suddenly appeared and offered to carry him across. The
man was at first doubtful, but ere long accepted the proffered help.
When they reached the middle of the river, the kelpy, who had hitherto
shown himself so obliging, sought to plunge his burden beneath the
water. A struggle ensued. The man finally found a foothold, and,
disengaging himself from the kelpy, scrambled in all haste up the bank.
His would-be destroyer, disappointed of his victim, hurled a boulder
after him. This boulder came to be known as the Kelpy&rsquo;s Stane.
Passers-by threw a stone beside it till eventually a heap was formed,
locally styled the Kelpy&rsquo;s Cairn. A Braemar kelpy stole a sackful
of meal from a mill to give it to a woman for whom he had taken a
fancy. As the thief was disappearing, the miller caught sight of him
and threw a fairy-whorl at his retreating figure. The whorl broke his
leg, and the kelpy fell into the mill-race and was drowned. Such was
the fate of the last kelpy seen in Braemar. Sutherland, too, abounded
in water-spirits. They used to cross the mouth of the Dornoch Firth in
cockle-shells, but, getting tired of this mode of transit, they
resolved to build a bridge. It was a magnificent structure, the piers
being headed with pure gold. A countryman, happening to pass, saw the
bridge, and invoked a blessing on the workmen and their work.
Immediately, the workmen vanished, and their work <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>sank
beneath the waves. Where it spanned the Firth there is now a sandbar
dangerous to mariners. Miss Dempster, who recounts this legend in the
&ldquo;<i>Folklore Journal</i>&rdquo; for 1888, supplies further
information about the superstition of the district. A banshee, adorned
with gold ornaments and wearing a silk dress, was seen hurrying down a
hill near the river Shin, and finally plunging into one of its deep
pools. These banshees were commonly web-footed, and seemed addicted to
finery, if we may judge from the instance just given, and from another
mentioned by Mr. Campbell in his &ldquo;<i>Tales of the West
Highlands</i>.&rdquo; He there speaks of one who frequented a stream
about four miles from Skibo Castle in Dornoch parish. The
miller&rsquo;s wife saw her. &ldquo;She was sitting on a stone, quiet,
and beautifully dressed in a green silk dress, the sleeves of which
were curiously puffed from the wrists to the shoulder. Her long hair
was yellow like ripe corn, but on nearer view she had no nose.&rdquo;
Miss Dempster narrates the following incident connected with the
water-spirit haunting another Sutherland river:&mdash;&ldquo;One,
William Munro, and the grandfather of the person from whom we have this
story, were one night leading half-a-dozen pack-horses across a ford in
the Oikel, on their way to a mill. When they neared the river bank a
horrid scream from the water struck their ears. &lsquo;It is the
Vaicgh,&rsquo; cried the lad, who was leading the first horse, and,
picking up some stones, he sent a shower of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>them
into the deep pool at his feet. She must have been repeatedly hit, as
she emitted a series of the most piercing shrieks. &lsquo;I am
afraid,&rsquo; said Monro, &lsquo;that you have not done that right,
and that she will play us an ugly trick at the ford.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Never mind, we will take more stones,&rsquo; he answered, arming
himself with a few. But the kelpy had had enough of stones for one
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off the Rhinns of Islay is a small island formerly used for grazing
cattle. A strong tide sweeps past the island, making the crossing of
the Sound dangerous. A story, related by Mr. Campbell, tells that on a
certain boisterous night a woman was left in charge of a large herd of
cattle on the island. She was sitting in her cabin, when all at once
she heard strange noises outside, and, looking up, saw a pair of large
eyes gazing in at her through the window. The door opened, and a
strange creature strode in. He was tall and hairy, with a livid
covering on his face instead of skin. He advanced towards the woman and
asked her name. She replied in Gaelic, &ldquo;Mise mi
Fhin&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Me myself.&rdquo; He then seized her. In her
terror she threw a ladleful of boiling water on the intruder. Yelling
with pain he bounded out of the hut. These unearthly voices asked what
was the matter, and who had hurt him? &ldquo;Mise mi
Fhin&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Me myself,&rdquo; replied the creature. The
answer was received with a shout of laughter from his mysterious
companions. The woman rushed out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>the hut, and
dislodging one of the cows lay down on the spot, at the same time
making a magical circle round her on the ground. All night she heard
terrible sounds mingling with the roaring of the wind. In the morning
the supernatural manifestations disappeared, and she felt herself safe.
It had not fared, however, so well with the cow, for, when found, it
was dead.</p>
<p>In Chapter I. reference was made to mermen and mermaids, and little
requires to be added in the present connection. In the south of
Scotland the very names of these sea-spirits have a far-off sound about
them. No one beside the Firths of Forth and Clyde expects nowadays to
catch sight of such strange forms sitting on rocks, or playing among
the breakers; but among our Northern Isles it is otherwise. Every now
and again (at long intervals, perhaps) the mysterious mermaid makes her
appearance, and gives new life to an old superstition. About three
years since, one was seen at Deerness in Orkney. She reappeared last
year, and was then noticed by some lobstermen who were working their
creels. She had a small black head, white body, and long arms. Somewhat
later, a creature, believed to be this mermaid, was shot not far from
the shore, but the body was not captured. In June of the present year
another mermaid was seen by the Deerness people. At Birsay, recently, a
farmer&rsquo;s wife was down at the sea-shore, and observed a strange
creature among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>the rocks. She went back for her husband, and
the two returned quite in time to get a good view of the interesting
stranger. The woman spoke of the mermaid as &ldquo;a good-looking
person&rdquo;; while her husband described her as &ldquo;having a
covering of brown hair.&rdquo; Curiosity seems to have been uppermost
in the minds of the couple, for they tried to capture the creature. In
the interests of folklore, if not of science, she managed to escape,
and was quickly lost to sight beneath the waves. Perhaps, as the
gurgling waters closed over her, she may have uttered an <i lang=
"fr">au revoir</i>, or whatever corresponds to that phrase in the
language of the sea. The following story about a mermaid, told by Mr.
J. H. Dixon in his &ldquo;<i>Gairloch</i>,&rdquo; published in 1886, is
fully credited in the district where the incident
occurred:&mdash;&ldquo;Roderick Mackenzie, the elderly and much
respected boat-builder at Port Henderson, when a young man, went one
day to a rocky part of the shore there. Whilst gathering bait he
suddenly spied a mermaid asleep among the rocks. Rorie &lsquo;went
for&rsquo; that mermaid, and succeeded in seizing her by the hair. The
poor creature in great embarrassment cried out that if Rorie would let
go she would grant him whatever boon he might ask. He requested a
pledge that no one should ever be drowned from any boat he might build.
On his releasing her the mermaid promised that this should be so. The
promise has been kept throughout Rorie&rsquo;s long business
career&mdash;his boats still defy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>the stormy winds and
waves.&rdquo; Mr. Dixon adds, &ldquo;I am the happy possessor of an
admirable example of Rorie&rsquo;s craft. The most ingenious framer of
trade advertisements might well take a hint from this veracious
anecdote.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far we have been dealing with water-spirits more or
less human in form. Another class consists of those with the shape and
attributes of horses and bulls. The members of this class are connected
specially with Highland districts. Lonely lochs were their favourite
haunts. In treeless regions, a belief in such creatures would naturally
arise. Any ordinary animal in such an environment would appear of a
larger size than usual, and the eye of the beholder would transmit the
error to his imagination, thereby still further magnifying the
creature&rsquo;s bulk. In some instances, the notion might arise even
when there was no animal on the scene. A piece of rock, or some other
physical feature of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>landscape would be enough to
excite superstitious fancies. Mr. Campbell remarks, &ldquo;In
Sutherland and elsewhere, many believe that they have seen these
fancied animals. I have been told of English sportsmen who went in
pursuit of them, so circumstantial were the accounts of those who
believed they had seen them. The witnesses are so numerous, and their
testimony agrees so well, that there must be some old deeply-rooted
Celtic belief which clothes every object with the dreaded form of the
Each Uisge, <i>i.e.</i>, Water-horse.&rdquo; When waves appeared on a
lake, and there seemed no wind to account for them, superstitious
people readily grasped at the idea that the phenomenon was due to the
action of some mysterious water-spirit. As Dr. Tylor points out, there
seems to have been a confusion &ldquo;between the &lsquo;spiritual
water-demon&rsquo; and the &lsquo;material
water-monster.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Any creature found in or near the
water would naturally be reckoned its guardian spirit.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Stewart gives the following particulars about
water-horses and water-bulls in his &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Twixt Ben Nevis
and Glencoe</i>.&rdquo; They are thought of &ldquo;as, upon the whole,
of the same shape and form as the more kindly quadrupeds after whom
they have been named, but larger, fiercer, and with an amount of
&lsquo;devilment&rsquo; and cunning about them, of which the latter,
fortunately, manifest no trace. They are always fat and sleek, and so
full of strength and spirit and life that the neighing of the one and
the bellowing of the other frequently awake <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>the
mountain echoes to their inmost recesses for miles and miles
around&#8202;&hellip;. Calves and foals are the result of occasional
intercourse between these animals and their more civilised domestic
congeners, such calves bearing unmistakable proofs of their mixed
descent in the unusual size and pendulousness of their ears and the
wide aquatic spread of their jet black hoofs; the foals, in their clean
limbs, large flashing eyes, red distended nostrils, and fiery spirit.
The initiated still pretend to point out cattle with more or less of
this questionable blood in them, in almost every drove of pure Highland
cows and heifers you like to bring under their notice.&rdquo; The lochs
of Llundavr&agrave; and Achtriachtan, in Glencoe, were at one time
famous for their water-bulls; and Loch Treig for its water-horses,
believed to be the fiercest specimens of that breed in the world. If
anyone suggested to a Lochaber or Rannoch Highlander that the cleverest
horse-tamer could &ldquo;clap a saddle on one of the demon-steeds of
Loch Treig, as he issues in the grey dawn, snorting, from his
crystal-paved sub-lacustral stalls, he would answer, with a look of
mingled horror and awe, &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; The water-horse would
tear him into a thousand pieces with his teeth and trample and pound
him into pulp with his jet-black, iron-hard, though unshod
hoofs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A noted demon-steed once inhabited Loch Ness, and was a cause of
terror to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Like other kelpies, he
was in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>habit of browsing along the roadside, all
bridled and saddled, as if waiting for some one to mount him. When any
unwary traveller did so, the kelpy took to his heels, and presently
plunged into deep water with his victim on his back. Mr. W. G. Stewart,
in his &ldquo;<i>Highland Superstitions and Amusements</i>,&rdquo;
tells a story to show that the kelpy in question did not always have
things his own way. A Highlander of the name of MacGrigor resolved to
throw himself in the way of the water-horse in the hope of getting the
better of him. The meeting took place in the solitary pass of
Slochd-Muichd, between Strathspey and Inverness. The kelpy looked as
innocent as usual, and was considerably startled when MacGrigor, sword
in hand, struck him a blow on the nose. The weapon cut through the
bridle, and the bit, falling to the ground, was instantly picked up by
MacGrigor. This was the turning point of the encounter. The kelpy was
powerless without his bit, and requested to have it restored. Though a
horse, the kelpy had the power of human speech, and conversed,
doubtless in excellent Gaelic, with his victor, using various arguments
to bring about the restoration of his lost property. Finding that these
were unavailing, he prophesied that MacGrigor would never enter his
house with the bit in his possession, and when they arrived at the door
he planted himself in front of it to block the entrance. The
Highlander, however, outwitted the kelpy, for, going round to the back
of his house, he called his wife and flung the bit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>to
her through a window. Returning to the kelpy, he told him where the bit
was, and assured him that he would never get it back again. As there
was a rowan cross above the door the demon-steed could not enter the
house, and presently departed uttering certain exclamations not
intended for benedictions. Those who doubt the truthfulness of the
narrative may have their doubts lessened when they learn that this was
not the only case of a water-horse&rsquo;s bit becoming the property of
a human being. The Rev. Dr. Stewart narrates an anecdote bearing on
this. A drover, whose home was in Nether Lochaber, was returning from a
market at Pitlochry by way of the Moor of Rannoch. Night came on; but,
as the moon was bright, he continued his journey without difficulty. On
reaching Lochanna Cuile, he sat down to refresh himself with bread,
cheese, and milk. While partaking of this temperate repast he caught
sight of something glittering on the ground, and, picking it up, he
found it to be a horse&rsquo;s bridle. Next morning he was astonished
to find that the bit and buckles were of pure silver and the reins of
soft and beautifully speckled leather. He was still more surprised to
find that the bit when touched was unbearably hot. A wise woman from a
neighbouring glen was called in to solve the mystery. She at once
recognised the article to be a water-horse&rsquo;s bridle, and
accounted for the high temperature of the bit on the ground that the
silver still retained the heat that it possessed when in a molten state
below ground. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span>reins, she said, were made of the skin of a
certain poisonous serpent that inhabited pools frequented by
water-horses. According to her directions, the bridle was hung on a
<i>cromag</i> or crook of rowan wood. Its presence brought a blessing
to the house, and the drover prospered in all his undertakings. When he
died, having no children of his own, he bequeathed the magical bridle
to his grandnephew, who prospered in his turn.</p>
<p>A pool in the North Esk, in Forfarshire, called the Ponage or
Pontage Pool, was at one time the home of a water-horse. This creature
was captured by means of a magical bridle, and kept in captivity for
some time. While a prisoner he was employed to carry stones to Morphie,
where a castle was then being built. One day the bridle was
incautiously removed, and the creature vanished, but not before he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Sair back an&rsquo; sair banes,</p>
<p class="line">Carryin&rsquo; the Laird o&rsquo; Morphie&rsquo;s
stanes;</p>
<p class="line">The Laird o&rsquo; Morphie canna thrive</p>
<p class="line">As lang&rsquo;s the kelpy is alive.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">His attempted verse-making seems to have gratified the
kelpy, for when he afterwards showed himself in the pool he was
frequently heard repeating the rhyme. The fate of the castle was
disastrous. At a later date it was entirely demolished, and its site
now alone remains. Some six miles from the Kirkton of Glenelg, in
Inverness-shire, is the small sheet of water known in the district as
John MacInnes&rsquo; Loch. It was so called from a crofter of that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>name who was drowned there. The circumstances
are thus narrated by Mr. J. Calder Ross in &ldquo;<i>Scottish Notes and
Queries</i>&rdquo; for February, 1893: &ldquo;John MacInnes found the
labour of his farm sadly burdensome. In the midst of his sighing an
unknown being appeared to him and promised a horse to him under certain
conditions. These conditions John undertook to fulfil. One day,
accordingly, he found a fine horse grazing in one of his fields. He
happened to be ploughing at the time, and at once he yoked the animal
to the plough along with another horse. The stranger worked splendidly,
and he determined to keep it, though he well knew that it was far from
canny. Every night when he stabled it he spread some earth from a
mole&rsquo;s hill over it as a charm; according to another version he
merely blessed the animal. One night he forgot his usual precautions:
perhaps he was beginning to feel safe. The horse noticed the omission,
and seizing poor John in his teeth, galloped off with him. The two
disappeared in the loch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Water-horses were not always malignant in disposition. On one
occasion an Aberdeenshire farmer went with his own horse to a mill to
fetch home some sacks of meal. He left the horse at the door of the
mill and went in to bring out the sacks. The beast, finding itself
free, started for home. When the farmer reappeared and found the
creature gone he was much disconcerted, and uttered the wish that he
might get any kind of horse to carry <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>his sacks even though
it were a water-kelpy. To his surprise, a water-horse immediately
appeared! It quietly allowed itself to be loaded with the meal, and
accompanied the farmer to his home. On reaching the house he tied the
horse to an old harrow till he should get the sacks taken into the
house. When he returned to stable the animal that had done him the good
turn, horse and harrow were away, and he heard the beast plunging not
far off in a deep pool in the Don. If anyone refuses to believe in the
existence of water-horses, let him go to the parish of Fearn, in
Forfarshire, and there, near the ruined castle of Vayne, he will see on
a sandstone rock the print of a kelpy&rsquo;s foot. Noran Water flows
below the castle, and the mysterious creature had doubtless its home in
one of its pools. In Shetland, such kelpies were known as Nuggles, and
showed themselves under the form of Shetland ponies.</p>
<p>MacCulloch, the author of &ldquo;<i>A Description of the Western
Islands of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; found the belief in the water-bull a
living faith among the people, notably among the dwellers beside Loch
Rannoch and Loch Awe. He tells of a farmer who employed his sons to
search a certain stream for one of these creatures, while the farmer
himself carried a gun loaded with sixpences to be discharged when the
monster appeared, silver alone having any effect on such beasts. The
same writer, when speaking of the grandeur of the scenery about Loch
Coruisk, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;It is not surprising that
Coruisk should be considered by the natives as the haunt of the
water-goblin or of spirits still more dreadful. A seaman, and a bold
one, whom, on one occasion, I had left in charge of the boat, became so
much terrified at finding himself alone that he ran off to join his
comrades, leaving it moored to the rock, though in danger of being
destroyed by the surge. I afterwards overheard much discussion on the
courage of the Southron in making the circuit of the valley unattended.
Not returning till it was nearly dark, it was concluded that he had
fallen into the fangs of the kelpy.&rdquo; MacCulloch&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>Description</i>&rdquo; consists of a series of letters to Sir
Walter Scott. Sir Walter himself has an interesting reference to the
same superstition in his &ldquo;<i>Journal</i>,&rdquo; under date
November 23rd, 1827. After enumerating the company at a certain dinner
party at which he had been present, he continues: &ldquo;Clanronald
told us, as an instance of Highland credulity, that a set of his
kinsmen&mdash;Borradale and others&mdash;believing that the fabulous
&lsquo;water-cow&rsquo; inhabited a small lake near his house, resolved
to drag the monster into day. With this view they bivouacked by the
side of the lake in which they placed, by way of night-bait, two small
anchors such as belong to boats, each baited with the carcase of a dog
slain for the purpose. They expected the &lsquo;water-cow&rsquo; would
gorge on this bait, and were prepared to drag her ashore the next
morning, when, to their confusion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>of face, the baits were found
untouched. It is something too late in the day for setting baits for
water-cows.&rdquo; If such conduct seemed wonderful in 1827, what would
the author of &ldquo;<i>Waverley</i>&rdquo; have thought had he known
that more than half-a-century later, people in the Highlands retained a
thorough-going belief in such monsters? No longer ago than 1884 rumours
were current in Ross-shire that a water-cow was seen in or near a loch
on the Greenstone Point, in Gairloch parish. Mr. J. H. Dixon, in his
&ldquo;<i>Gairloch</i>,&rdquo; states that about 1840 a water-cow was
believed to inhabit Loch-na-Beiste, in the same parish, and that a
serious attempt was then made to destroy the creature. The proprietor
tried to drain the loch, which, except at one point, is little more
than a fathom in depth; but when his efforts failed he threw a quantity
of quicklime into the water to poison the monster. It is reasonable to
hold that the trout were the only sufferers. The creature in question
was described by two men who saw it as in appearance like &ldquo;a good
sized boat with the keel turned up.&rdquo; Belief in the existence of
water-cows prevailed in the south as well as in the north of Scotland.
In the Yarrow district there was one inhabiting St. Mary&rsquo;s Loch.
Concerning this water-cow, Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, writes: &ldquo;A
farmer in Bowerhope once got a breed of her, which he kept for many
years until they multiplied exceedingly; and he never had any cattle
throve so well, until once, on some outrage or disrespect on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>farmer&rsquo;s part towards them, the old dam
came out of the lake one pleasant March evening and gave such a roar
that all the surrounding hills shook again, upon which her progeny,
nineteen in number, followed her all quietly into the loch, and were
never more seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Isle of Man the water-bull was, and perhaps still is believed
in by the peasantry. It is called in Manx, tarroo-ushtey. There is much
force in Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s conclusion that the old Celts reverenced
a destroying water-god, to whom the horse was sacred, or who assumed
the form of a horse. A similar notion may have originated the belief in
the water-bull.</p>
<p>Other creatures, besides those already mentioned, acted in the
capacity of water spirits. In Strathmartin, in Forfarshire, is a spring
styled the Nine Maidens&rsquo; Well. These maidens were the daughters
of a certain Donewalde or Donald in the eighth century, and led, along
with their father, a saintly life in the glen of Ogilvy in the same
county. Their spring at Strathmartin must have been well looked after,
for it had as its guardian, no less formidable a creature than a
dragon. We do not know whether there was any St. George in the vicinity
to dispute possession with the monster. In Kildonan parish, Sutherland,
a stagnant pool of water, some ten yards long by three broad, was
regarded by the inhabitants with superstitious dread. According to
tradition, a pot of gold lay hidden below; but no one could reach the
treasure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>as it was guarded by a large black dog with two
heads. The Rev. Donald Sage, when noticing this superstition in his
&ldquo;<i>Memorabilia Domestica</i>,&rdquo; remarks, &ldquo;It is said
that a tenant once had attempted to drain the loch and had succeeded,
so that the water was all carried off. The only remuneration the
unfortunate agriculturist received was to be aroused from his midnight
slumbers by a visit from the black dog, which set up such a hideous
howl as made the hills reverberate and the poor man almost die with
fright. Furthermore, with this diabolical music, he was regularly
serenaded at the midnight hour till he had filled up the drain, and the
loch had resumed its former dimensions.&rdquo; We do not know whether
any later attempt was made to abolish the stagnant pool; but at any
rate a dread of the black dog kept it from being again drained till
well on in the present century. Sutherland, however, cannot claim a
monopoly in the matter of a guardian spirit in the shape of a dog.
Concerning Hound&rsquo;s Pool in Dean Combe parish, Devon, the
tradition is that it is haunted by a hound doomed to keep guard till
the pool can be emptied by a nutshell with a hole in it. Readers of
&ldquo;<i>Peveril of the Peak</i>&rdquo; can hardly fail to remember
the Moddey Dhoo&mdash;the black demon-dog&mdash;that roamed through
Peel Castle, in the Isle of Man. St. Michael&rsquo;s Well in
Kirkmichael parish, Banffshire, had for its guardian spirit a much
smaller animal than any of the above. It showed itself in the form of a
fly that kept skimming over the surface of the water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>This
fly was believed to be immortal. Towards the end of last century the
spring lost its reputation for its cures, and the guardian spirit
shared in its neglect. The writer of the article on the parish, in the
&ldquo;<i>Old Statistical Account of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; mentions
having met an old man who greatly deplored the degeneracy of the times.
A glowing picture is given of this old man&rsquo;s desires. &ldquo;If
the infirmities of years and the distance of his residence did not
prevent him, he would still pay his devotional visits to the well of
St. Michael. He would clear the bed of its ooze, opening a passage for
the streamlet, plant the borders with fragrant flowers, and once more,
as in the days of youth, enjoy the pleasure of seeing the guardian fly
skim in sportive circles over the bubbling waves, and with its little
proboscis imbibe the panacean dews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consecrated fish have been reverenced, from of old, in East and West
alike. In Syria, at the present day, such fish are preserved in
fountains; and anciently certain pools in the stream, flowing past
Ascalon, were the abodes of fish sacred to Derketo, the Ph&oelig;nician
Venus, who had a temple there. In our own land the same cult prevailed.
A curious Cornish legend tells how St. Neot had his well stocked with
fish by an angel. These fish were always two in number. Day by day, the
saint had one for dinner, and its place was miraculously supplied to
keep up the proper number. One day he fell sick, and his servant,
contrary to all ascetic precedent, cooked both and set them before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>his master. The saint was horrified, and had
both the fish&mdash;cooked though they were&mdash;put back into the
spring. He sought forgiveness for the rash act, and lo! the fish became
alive once more; and as a further sign that the sacrilege was condoned,
St. Neot, on eating his usual daily portion, was at once restored to
health. In Scotland there were various springs containing consecrated
fish. Loch Siant, in the Isle of Skye, described by MacCulloch as
&ldquo;the haunt of the gentler spirits of air and water,&rdquo;
abounded in trout; but, as Martin informs us, neither the natives nor
strangers ever dared to kill any of them on account of the esteem in
which the water was held. This superstition seems to have been
specially cherished in the island, for Martin further says, &ldquo;I
saw a little well in Kilbride, in the south of Skie, with one Trout
only in it; the natives are very tender of it, and though they often
chance to catch it in their wooden pales, they are very careful to
preserve it from being destroyed; it has been there for many
years.&rdquo; In a well near the church of Kilmore, in Lorne, were two
fishes held in much respect in the seventeenth century, and called by
the people of the district, Easg Seant, <i>i.e.</i>, holie fishes. From
Dalyell&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Darker Superstitions of Scotland</i>&rdquo;
we learn that, like those belonging to St. Neot, they were always two
in number: they never varied in size: in colour they were black, and
according to the testimony of the most aged persons their hue never
altered. In Tober Kieran, near Kells, County Meath, Ireland,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>were two miraculous trout which never changed
their appearance. A Strathdon legend, narrated by the Rev. Dr. Gregor,
thus accounts for the appearance of fish in Tobar Vachar, <i>i.e.</i>,
St. Machar&rsquo;s Well, at Corgarff, a spring formerly held in high
honour on account of its cures:&mdash;&ldquo;Once there was a famine in
the district, and not a few were dying of hunger. The priest&rsquo;s
house stood not far from the well. One day, during the famine, his
housekeeper came to him and told him that their stock of food was
exhausted, and that there was no more to be got in the district. The
priest left the house, went to the well, and cried to St. Machar for
help. On his return he told the servant to go to the well the next
morning at sunrise, walk three times round it, in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, without looking into it, and draw from it
a draught of water for him. She carried out the request. On stooping
down to draw the water, she saw three fine salmon swimming in the well.
They were caught, and served the two as food, till supply came to the
famine-stricken district from other quarters.&rdquo; According to a
Herefordshire tradition, a fish with a golden chain round it was caught
in the river Dore, and was afterwards kept in the spring whence the
river flows. At Peterchurch, in that county, is a sculptured stone
bearing a rude representation of the fish in question.</p>
<p>Sometimes the guardian spirit of a loch or well was thought of in
the vaguest possible way. In that case the <i>genius loci</i> had
neither name nor shape of any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>kind, the leaving of an
offering being the only recognition of his existence. Occasionally the
presiding spirit was pictured in the popular imagination in the guise
of a demon, commonly with a hazy personality. Callow Pit, in Norfolk,
was believed to contain a treasure-chest guarded by such a being. On
one occasion an attempt to raise the chest was made, and was on the
verge of being successful, when one of the treasure-hunters defied the
devil to get his own again. Suddenly the chest was snatched down into
the pit, and the ring, attached to the lid, alone remained to tell its
tale. This ring was afterwards fixed to the door of Southwood Church.
At Wavertree, in Lancashire, once stood a monastery and beside it was a
well. When pilgrims arrived, the occupants of the monastery received
their alms. If nothing was given, a demon, chained to the bottom of the
well, was said to laugh. This notion was either originated or
perpetuated by a fifteenth century Latin inscription to this effect,
&ldquo;<i>Qui non dat quad habet. Daemon infra ridet.</i>&rdquo; When
wells were dedicated to Christian saints, the latter were usually
considered the guardians of the sacred water. This was natural enough.
If, for instance, St. Michael was supposed to watch over a spring, why
should not his aid have been sought in connection with any wished-for
cure? It is interesting, however, to note that this was not so in every
instance. In many cases the favourite, because favourable time for
visiting a sacred spring, was not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>the festival of the saint to
whom it was dedicated, but, as we shall see hereafter, a day quite
distinct from such festival. Petitions, too, were frequently addressed
not to the saint of the well, but to some being with a character
possessing fewer Christian attributes. All this points to the fact that
the origin of well-worship is to be sought, not in the legends of
medi&aelig;val Christianity, but in the crude fancies of an earlier
paganism. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Offerings at lochs and springs have been incidentally
mentioned more than once, but the subject is one deserving separate
treatment. Wells were not merely so much water, with stones and turf
round them, and lochs, sheets of water, encompassed by moorland or
forest. They were, as we have seen, the haunts of spirits, propitious
if remembered, but resentful if neglected. Hence no one thought it
proper to come to them empty-handed. The principle was, no gift, no
cure. Classical literature contains allusions to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>such
votive offerings. Numa sacrificed a sheep to a fountain, and Horace
promised to offer to his sweet Bandusian spring a kid not without
flowers. Near Toulouse, in France, was a sacred lake, into whose water
the neighbouring tribes anciently threw offerings of gold and silver.
In our own country, the gifts were, as a rule, of small intrinsic
value. When speaking of Toubir-nim-buadh, in St. Kilda, Macaulay
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Near the fountain stood an altar on which the
distressed votaries laid down their oblations. Before they could touch
the sacred water with any prospect of success, it was their constant
practice to address the genius of the place with supplication and
prayer. No one approached him with empty hands. But the devotees were
abundantly frugal. The offerings, presented by them, were the poorest
acknowledgments that could be made to a superior being, from whom they
had either hopes or fears. Shells and pebbles, rags of linen, or stuffs
worn out, pins, needles, or rusty nails, were generally all the tribute
that was paid; and sometimes, though rarely enough, copper coins of the
smallest value.&rdquo; The appearance of this well is thus described by
the author of &ldquo;<i>Ecclesiological
Notes</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;A low square-shaped massy stone building
with a stone roof, covers the spring, which, after forming a pool in
the floor of the cell, runs down the russet slope like a thread of
silver to join the stream in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The offerings, made by the St. Kildians, were indeed much the same
as those commonly made in other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>parts of the country. We get
a glimpse of what was done in the south of Scotland from Symson, who,
in his quaint &ldquo;<i>Description of Galloway</i>,&rdquo;
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;In this parish of Bootle, about a mile from the
kirk, towards the north, is a well called the Rumbling Well, frequented
by a multitude of sick people for all sorts of diseases the first
Sunday of May; lying there the Saturday night, and then drinking of it
early in the morning. There is also another well, about a quarter of a
mile distant from the former, towards the east. This well is made use
of by the country people when their cattle are troubled with a disease
called by them the Connoch. This water they carry in vessels to many
parts and wash their beasts with it, and give it them to drink. It is,
too, remembered that at both the wells they leave behind them something
by way of a thank-offering. At the first, they leave either money or
clothes; at the second, they leave the bands and shackles wherewith
beasts are usually bound.&rdquo; The objects, commonly left on the
cairns beside the Holy Pool in Strathfillan, have already been
enumerated. In addition, bunches of heath, tied with worsted, were
occasionally left. The Cheese Well, on Minchmoor, in Peeblesshire, was
so called from the pieces of cheese thrown into it by passers-by as
offerings to the fairies. Around a certain spring near Newcastle, in
Northumberland, the bushes were so covered with shreds of clothing that
the spring went by the name of the Rag Well. At St. Oswald&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>Well, near the foot of Roseberry Topping, in
Yorkshire, the pieces of cloth were so numerous that, as a spectator
once remarked, they &ldquo;might have made a fair ream in a
paper-mill.&rdquo; A contributor to &ldquo;<i>Notes and
Queries</i>,&rdquo; in 1876, observes:&mdash;&ldquo;The custom of
hanging shreds of rags on trees as votive offerings still obtains in
Ireland. I remember as a child to have been surreptitiously taken by an
Irish nurse to St. John&rsquo;s Well, Aghada, County Cork, on the vigil
of the saint&rsquo;s day, to be cured of whooping-cough by drinking
three times of the water of the holy well. I shall never forget the
strange spectacle of men and women, creeping on their knees in
voluntary devotion, or in obedience to enjoined penance, so many times
round the well, which was protected by a grey stone hood, and had a few
white thorn trees growing near it, on the spines of which fluttered
innumerable shreds of frieze and vary-coloured rags, the votive
offerings of devotees and patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Isle of Man, also, the custom of hanging up rags was at one
time much in vogue. In Malew parish there is Chibber-Undin, signifying
the Foundation Well, so called from the foundations of a now almost
obliterated chapel hard by. The ritual practised at the well is thus
described by Mr. A. W. Moore in his &ldquo;<i>Surnames and Place-names
of the Isle of Man</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;The patients who came to
it, took a mouthful of water, retaining it in their mouths till they
had twice walked round the well. They then took a piece of cloth from a
garment which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>they had worn, wetted it from the water from the
well, and hung it on the hawthorn tree which grew there. When the cloth
had rotted away the cure was supposed to be effected.&rdquo; Evidence
from Wales to the same effect is furnished by Professor Rhys in
&ldquo;<i>Folklore</i>&rdquo; for September, 1892. He there gives the
following information, lately sent to him by a friend, about a
Glamorganshire holy well situated between Coychurch and
Bredgled:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the custom,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;for
people suffering from any malady to dip a rag in the water, and bathe
the affected part. The rag is then placed on a tree close to the well.
When I passed it, about three years ago, there were hundreds of these
shreds covering the tree, and some had evidently been placed there very
recently.&rdquo; Professor Rhys also refers to other Glamorganshire
springs where rags are to be seen hanging on trees.</p>
<p>Scottish examples of the same superstition are numerous. At
Montblairie, in Banffshire, pieces of linen and woollen stuffs were
hung on the boughs beside a consecrated well, and farthings and bodles
were thrown into the spring itself. The bushes around a well at
Houston, in Renfrewshire, were at one time the recipients of many a
rag. Hugh Miller, who took so keen an interest in all such relics of
superstition, has not failed to notice the custom as practised near his
native town of Cromarty. In his &ldquo;<i>Scenes and Legends of the
North of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; he says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is not yet
twenty years since a thorn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>bush, which formed a little canopy
over the spring of St. Bennet, used to be covered anew every season
with little pieces of rag, left on it as offerings to the saint by sick
people who came to drink of the water.&rdquo; St. Wallach&rsquo;s Bath,
in Strathdeveron, was a popular health-resort till the beginning of the
present century. Non-thriving children were brought to it annually in
large numbers. No longer ago than 1874 an invalid from the seaside
sought its aid. The bath&mdash;a cavity in the rock fully a yard in
depth&mdash;is close to the river, and is supplied with water from a
scanty spring, several yards higher up the slope. The supply trickles
over the edge of the bath into the river, some four feet below. A bib
or other part of the child&rsquo;s clothing was hung on a neighbouring
tree or thrown into the bath. Sometimes when the Deveron was in flood,
it submerged the bath, and swept these offerings down to the sea. As
previously mentioned, St. Wallach&rsquo;s Well, hard by, was much
resorted to for the cure of sore eyes. Pins were the usual offerings.
They were left in a hole in a stone beside the well. May was the
favourite season for visiting the spring, and by the end of the month
the hole was often full of pins. This was the case down to a
comparatively recent date.</p>
<p>Offerings, such as pins, were often thrown into the well itself
instead of being left beside its margin. Near Wooler, in
Northumberland, on the southern slopes of the Cheviots, is a spring
locally styled the Pin Well. A fairy was believed to make it her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>home, and maidens, as they passed, dropped in a
crooked pin to gain her good graces. Crooked pins were rather popular,
anything so bent&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, a crooked sixpence&mdash;being
deemed lucky. In the case of more than one English spring the notion
prevailed that, when a pin was thrown in, the votary would see the pins
already there rise to meet the newcomer. But faith was essential.
Otherwise the mysterious vision would be withheld. We do not know that
a corresponding belief prevailed north of the Tweed. Between the glens
of Corgarff and Glengairn in Aberdeenshire, is the spring known as
Tobar-na-Glas-a-Coille or The Well in the Grey Wood. A pin or other
piece of metal had to be dropped into it by anyone taking a draught of
its water. Whoever neglected this duty, and at any time afterwards
again drew water from the spring, was doomed to die of thirst. Some of
these votive pins were found at the bottom of the well, no longer ago
than the autumn of 1891.</p>
<p>Probably very few travellers by the Callander and Oban railway are
aware of the existence of an interesting, but now neglected holy well,
only a few yards distant from the line. It is situated at the entrance
of rugged Glen Ogle, and from the spot a fine view can be had of Ben
Lawers, Ben More, and Ben Loy. The well is on Wester Lix farm, and is
locally known as the Lix Well. The spring rises in one of the many
hillocks in the neighbourhood. The top of the hillock had been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>levelled. Round the spring is built a wall of
stone and turf, about two feet in height, and shaped like a horse-shoe,
the opening being to the east. The distance across the enclosed space
is about fourteen feet. In the centre is the well, in the form of a
parallelogram, two feet by one and a half, with a long drain leading
from it through the opening of the horse-shoe. This drain was at one
time covered with flagstones. Four shapely lintels of micaceous schist
enclose the well. The spot used to be frequented at the beginning of
May, the wall already referred to forming a convenient resting-place
for visitors. Quartz pebbles were the favourite offerings on these
occasions. Immediately behind the well, quite a small cairn of them can
still be seen. Pebbles were among the cheapest possible offerings, the
only cost being the trouble of picking them up. Coins were rather more
expensive; but, as they were commonly of small value, the outlay was
trifling even in their case. The more fervent the zeal of the votary,
the greater would doubtless be the length he or she would go in the
matter of expense. In the parish of Culsalmond, in Aberdeenshire, a
gold coin of James I. of Scotland was found associated with an ancient
healing-well. Such liberality, however, was rare. After <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2368" title="Source: desribing">describing</span> St.
Maelrubha&rsquo;s Well on Innis Maree in the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; volume iv., Sir
Arthur Mitchell observes, &ldquo;Near it stands an oak tree, which is
studded with nails. To each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of these was originally attached a
piece of the clothing of some patient who had visited the spot. There
are hundreds of nails, and one has still fastened to it a faded ribbon.
Two bone buttons and two buckles we also found nailed to the tree.
Countless pennies and halfpennies are driven edge-ways into the
wood&mdash;over many the bark is closing, over many it has already
closed.&rdquo; Within recent years, another visitor from the south
examined one of the coins stuck into the tree. It was ostensibly
silver, but proved on examination to be counterfeit. The pilgrim, who
left it as an offering, evidently thought that the saint could be
easily imposed upon.</p>
<p>As in the case of the pins, the coins, given as offerings were, as a
rule, thrown into the spring itself. As an example, we may cite the
case of St. Jergon&rsquo;s or St. Querdon&rsquo;s Well in Troqueer
parish, Kirkcudbrightshire. In an article in the &ldquo;<i>Transactions
of the Dumfries and Galloway Natural History Society</i>&rdquo; for
1870, Mr. Patrick Dudgeon remarks, &ldquo;Taking advantage of the very
dry summer of last year when the spring was unusually low, I had the
well thoroughly cleaned out and put in order, it having been almost
obliterated by cattle being allowed to use it as a watering-place.
Several hundreds of coins were found at the bottom&mdash;almost all
being of the smallest description of copper coin, dating from the time
of Elizabeth to that of George III&#8202;&hellip;. None were of any
particular interest or value; the greatest number are Scottish,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>and belong to the time of James VI., Charles I.,
and Charles II. The circumstance that no coins were found of an older
date than the reign of Elizabeth is not at all conclusive that
offerings of a similar nature had not been made at much earlier
periods. It will be observed that the oldest coins are the thinnest,
and that, although many are as thin as a sheet of writing paper, the
legend on them is perfectly distinct and legible; this, of course,
would not have been the case had the thinning process been owing to
wear and tear. When first taken out, they were perfectly
bright&mdash;as new copper&mdash;and had all the appearance of having
been subjected to the action of an acid. Something in the water has
acted very slowly as a solvent on the metal, and, acting quite equally
over the whole surface, has reduced the coins to their present state:
it is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that, owing to the solvent
properties of the water, any coins thrown into the well anterior to the
date of those found may have been completely dissolved.&rdquo; Mr.
Dudgeon mentions having been told by old people in the neighbourhood,
that they remembered the time, when rags and ribbons were hung on the
bushes around the well. It is a remarkable circumstance that even since
the cleaning out of the spring above referred to, coins have been
thrown into it. A recent examination of the spot brought these to
light, and showed the persistence of this curious phase of
well-worship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>What would be styled &ldquo;a collection in silver&rdquo; in modern
ecclesiastical language was sometimes regarded with special favour. The
name of the Silver Wells in different parts of the country can thus be
accounted for. There is a <i>Siller</i> Well in Walston parish,
Lanarkshire. Arbroath, in Forfarshire; Alvah, in Banffshire; and
Fraserburgh, in Aberdeenshire, have each their Silver Well. At Turriff,
in the last-mentioned county, there is a farm on the estate of Gask
called Silver Wells after a local spring. At Trelevean, in Cornwall, is
a spring known as the Brass Well. Its name, however, is derived not
from the nature of the offerings left there, but from the colour of the
scum on its surface. Close to the ruins of Avoch Castle, in the Black
Isle, is a well hollowed out of the conglomerate rock. Tradition says,
that the treasures of the castle were thrown into it about the middle
of the seventeenth century. This was done, not by way of offering a
gift to the presiding spirit of the water, but to prevent the valuables
from falling into the hands of Cromwell&rsquo;s troops. A diamond ring
was dropped, not very long ago, into St. Molio&rsquo;s Well, on Holy
Island, near Lamlash. It fell into the water by accident, and, after
remaining in it for some time, was found and restored to its owner.</p>
<p>The present ample water-supply of Glasgow from Loch Katrine was
introduced in 1859. For about fifty years before that date, the city
looked mainly to the Clyde for the supply of its daily needs. Still
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>earlier, it depended entirely on its wells. In
1736 these are believed to have numbered about thirty in all. Among the
best known were the Deanside or Meadow Well, Bogle&rsquo;s Well,
Barrasyett Well near the foot of Saltmarket, the Priest&rsquo;s or
Minister&rsquo;s Well and Lady Well beside the Molendinar, the Arns
Well in the Green&mdash;so-called from the alders on its brink, and St.
Thenew&rsquo;s Well, near what is now St. Enoch&rsquo;s Square. Not far
from the well was a chapel dedicated to St. Thenew, with a graveyard
round it. Some remains of the chapel were to be seen in 1736, when
M&rsquo;Ure wrote his history of the city. Dr. Andrew MacGeorge, in his
&ldquo;<i>Old Glasgow</i>,&rdquo; when describing St. Thenew&rsquo;s
Well, remarks, &ldquo;It was shaded by an old tree which drooped over
the well, and which remained till the end of the last century. On this
tree, the devotees, who frequented the well, were accustomed to nail,
as thank-offerings, small bits of tin-iron&mdash;probably manufactured
for that purpose by a craftsman in the neighbourhood&mdash;representing
the parts of the body supposed to have been cured by the virtues of the
sacred spring, such as eyes, hands, feet, ears, and others.&rdquo; Dr.
MacGeorge further mentions that the well was cleaned out about a
hundred years ago. On that occasion there were &ldquo;picked out from
among the debris at the bottom several of these old votive offerings
which had dropped into it from the tree, the stump of which was at that
time still standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horace tells of a shipwrecked sailor, hanging up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>his
garments, as a thank-offering in the temple of the divinity who
delivered him from the angry sea. In like manner, Pennant describes
what he saw at St. Winifred&rsquo;s Well, in North Wales. &ldquo;All
infirmities,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;incident to the human body, met
with relief; the votive crutches, the barrows and other proofs of
cures, to this moment remain as evidence pendent over the well.&rdquo;
In his &ldquo;<i>Spring of Kinghorn Craig</i>,&rdquo; published in
Edinburgh in 1618, Dr. Patrick Anderson has some curious remarks on the
subject of votive offerings. He speaks of wells as being &ldquo;all
tapestried about with old rags, as certaine signes and sacraments
wherewith they arle the well with ane arls-pennie of their
health.&rdquo; He continues, &ldquo;So suttle is that false knave
making them believe that it is only the virtue of the water, and no
thing else. Such people cannot say with David, &lsquo;The Lord is my
helper,&rsquo; but the Devill.&rdquo; What can still be seen on the
other side of the English Channel is thus described by the Rev. C. N.
Barham, in an article on Ragged Relics, in &ldquo;<i>The
Antiquary</i>&rdquo; for January, 1893:&mdash;&ldquo;At Wierre Effroy,
in France, where the water of St. Godeleine&rsquo;s Well is esteemed
efficacious for ague, rheumatism, gout, and all affections of the
limbs, a heterogeneous collection of crutches, bandages, coils of rags,
and other rejected adjuncts of medical treatment, is to be seen hanging
upon the surrounding shrubs. They are intended as <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2407" title="Source: thankofferings">thank-offerings</span>
and testimonies of restoration. Other springs, famous for curing
ophthalmia, abound <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>in the same district, and here too,
bandages, shades, guards, and rags innumerable are
exhibited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leaving of offerings at wells finds a parallel in the practice,
at one time common, of depositing gifts in consecrated buildings. The
chapel of St. Tears, in the parish of Wick, Caithness, used to be
visited on Childermas (December 28th) by devotees, who left in it
pieces of bread and cheese as offerings to the souls of the Holy
Innocents slain by Herod. This was done till about the beginning of the
present century. Till even a later date it was customary for the
inhabitants of Mirelandorn to go to the Kirk of Moss, in the same
parish, on Christmas before sunrise. They took bread and cheese as
offerings, and placed them along with a silver coin on a certain stone.
The Kirk of Moss was dedicated to Duthac, patron saint of Tain; and the
gifts were doubtless destined for him. On Eilean M&ograve;r is a chapel
said to have been built by Charmaig, the tutelar saint of the island.
In a recess in this building is a stone coffin, anciently used for the
interment of priests. The following statement occurs in the
&ldquo;<i>Old Statistical Account of
Scotland</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;The coffin, also, for ages back, has
served the saint as a treasury; and this, perhaps, might be the purpose
for which it was originally intended. Till of late, not a stranger set
foot on the island who did not conciliate his favour by dropping a
small coin into a chink between its cover and side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we examine the motives prompting to the practice under review,
we can discover the working <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href=
"#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>of a principle, vaguely grasped
perhaps, but sufficiently understood to serve as a guide to action.
This crude philosophy was two-fold. On the one hand, the gift left at a
loch or spring was what has been facetiously styled a &ldquo;retaining
fee.&rdquo; It secured the goodwill of the <i>genius loci</i>, and
thereby guaranteed to a certain extent the fulfilment of the
suppliant&rsquo;s desire. This desire, as we have seen, was commonly
the removal of a definite disease. On the other hand, the disease to be
removed was in some mysterious way identified with the offering. The
latter was the symbol, or rather the embodiment of the former, and,
accordingly, to leave the gift was to leave the ailment&mdash;the
patient being thus freed from both. The corollary to this was, that
whoever removed the offering took away also the disease represented by
it. According to a well-established law of medical science, infection
is transferred from one person to another by clothing, or indeed by
whatever comes into contact with the morbid particles from the
patient&rsquo;s body. But infection in folklore is something different
from this. Disease of any kind, whether usually reckoned infectious or
not, passed <i>via</i> the offering to the person lifting it. Hence
such gifts had a charmed existence, and were as safe as if under the
sweep of the &ldquo;Ancient Monuments Protection Act.&rdquo; The Rev.
Dr. Gregor thus expresses the feeling on this point, as it prevailed
till lately in the north-east of Scotland:&mdash;&ldquo;No one would
have been foolhardy enough to have even touched what had been left, far
less to have carried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span>it off. A child, or one who did not know,
was most carefully instructed why such things were left in and around
the well, and strict charge was laid not to touch or carry any of them
off. Whoever carried off one of such relics contracted the disease of
the one who left it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notion that disease can be transferred lies at the root of
various folk-cures. Dalyell, in his &ldquo;<i>Darker
Superstitions</i>,&rdquo; remarks, &ldquo;It is said that, in the
Highlands, a cat is washed in the water which has served for the
ablution of an invalid, as if the disease absorbed from one living
creature could be received by another, instead of being let
free.&rdquo; In some parts of the Highlands, a common cure for an
ailing cow was to make the animal swallow a live trout, so that the
disease might pass from the one creature to the other. This was done
not long ago, at a farm near Golspie, in Sutherland. In Norfolk, as a
remedy for whooping-cough, a spider was caught, tied up in a piece of
muslin, and pinned over the mantelpiece. The cough disappeared when the
spider died. In Gloucestershire, ague was cured in the following
way:&mdash;A living snail was worn in a bag round the neck for nine
days. The snail was then thrown upon the fire when it was believed to
shake as if with ague, and the patient recovered. Many more
illustrations of this principle might be given, but the above are
sufficient to show how it was applied.</p>
<p>Symson records an instance in Galloway of swift <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>vengeance following the theft of certain votive
offerings. He says, &ldquo;Hereabout, <i>i.e.</i>, near Larg, in
Minnigaff parish, is a well called the Gout Well of Larg, of which they
tell this story&mdash;how that a piper stole away the offering left at
this well, but when he was drinking of ale, which he intended to pay
with the money he had taken away, the gout, as they say, seized on him,
of which he could not be cured, but at that well, having first restored
to it the money he had formerly taken away.&rdquo; Accident, rather
than disease, sometimes resulted from such sacrilegious acts. The
offerings were the property of the guardian spirit who was quick to
resent their removal and to punish the doer of the deed. In the
district of Ardnamurchan is a cave, associated with Columba, who there
baptised some freebooters. The water used for the purpose lay in a
hollow of the rock, and, in after times, votive gifts were left beside
it. On one occasion, a young man stole some of these, but he did not
remain long unpunished, for before reaching home he fell and broke his
leg. Tobar-fuar-M&ograve;rie, <i>i.e.</i>, The big cold Well, situated
at the foot of a steep hill in the parish of Corgarff, Aberdeenshire,
consists of three springs about a yard distant from each other. Each
spring formerly cured a separate disease&mdash;one, blindness; the
other, deafness; and the third, lameness. The guardian spirit of the
springs lived under a large stone called the kettle stone, because
below it was a kettle where she stored her votive offerings. She was
somewhat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>exacting in her demands, for no cure could be
expected unless gold was presented<span class="corr" id="xd26e2446"
title="Source: ,">.</span> These particulars were obtained in the
district by the Rev. Dr. Gregor, who records them in
&ldquo;<i>Folklore</i>&rdquo; for March, 1892, and adds, &ldquo;If one
tried to rob the spirit, death by some terrible accident soon followed.
My informant, more than fifty years ago, when a lad, resolved to remove
the kettle stone from its position, and so become possessor of the
spirit&rsquo;s gold. He accordingly set out with a few companions all
provided with picks and spades, to displace the stone. After a good
deal of hard labour the stone was moved from its site, but no kettle
full of gold was found. An old woman met the lads on their way to their
homes, and when she learnt what they had been doing, she assured them
they would all die within a few weeks, and that a terrible death would
befall the ring-leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the guardians of springs look well after their possessions in
the new world, as well as in the old, is proved by the following
quotation from Sir J. Lubbock&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Origin of
Civilisation</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;In North Mexico,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;Lieutenant Whipple found a sacred spring which, from time
immemorial &lsquo;had been held sacred to the rain-god.&rsquo; No
animal may drink of its waters. It must be annually cleansed with
ancient vases, which, having been transmitted from generation to
generation by the caciques, are then placed upon the walls, never to be
removed. The frog, the tortoise, and the rattlesnake represented upon
them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>are sacred to Montezuma, the patron of the
place, who would consume by lightning any sacrilegious hand that should
dare to take the relics away.&rdquo; With the growth of enlightenment
men&rsquo;s minds rose above such delusions. Had it not been so, the
Holy Wells in our land would still have presented the appearance of rag
fairs, or served as museums for old coins. Holy Loch, in Dunnet,
Caithness, used to be much resorted to as a place of healing. The
invalids walked or were carried round the lake and threw a penny into
the water. Some of these pennies have been picked up from time to time
by persons who have outgrown the old superstition. The hollow in the
Clach-nan-Sul at Balquhidder, already referred to, contained small
coins placed there by those who sought a cure for their sore eyes. Mr.
J. Mackintosh Gow was told by some one in the district, that
&ldquo;people, when going to church, having forgotten their small
change, used in passing to put their hands in the well and find a
coin.&rdquo; Mr. Gow&rsquo;s informant mentioned that he had done so
himself.</p>
<p>In the ceremony known as &ldquo;well-dressing&rdquo; or
&ldquo;well-flowering,&rdquo; the offerings took the form of blossoms
and green boughs. For different reasons Scotland has not been abreast
of England in floral matters. Only in the latter country did the
practice take root, and even there only within a somewhat limited area.
We must seek for its home in Derbyshire and the adjacent counties. At
some places it has died out, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>while at others it still survives,
and forms the excuse for a pleasant holiday. At Bonchurch, Isle of
Wight, indeed, St. Boniface&rsquo;s Well was decorated with wreaths of
flowers on the saint&rsquo;s day; but this was an exceptional instance
so far south. Within comparatively recent years well-flowering has, at
one or two places, been either instituted, as at Belper, in Derbyshire,
in 1838, or revived, as at St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Well in Derby, in 1870.
The clergy and choir of St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Church celebrate the day by
meeting at the church and walking in procession to the well. Writing in
the seventeenth century, Aubrey says, &ldquo;In Cheshire, when they
went in perambulation, they did bless the springs, <i>i.e.</i>, they
did read the Gospel at them, and did believe the water was the
better.&rdquo; At Droitwich, in Worcestershire, a salt spring,
dedicated to St. Richard, used to be annually adorned with flowers.</p>
<p>A correspondent of the &ldquo;<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>&rdquo; of 1794 remarks, &ldquo;In the village of
Tissington, in the county of Derby, a place remarkable for fine springs
of water, it has been a custom, time immemorial, on every Holy
Thursday, to decorate the wells with boughs of trees, garlands of
tulips, and other flowers, placed in various fancied devices, and,
after prayers for the day at the church, for the parson and singers to
pray and sing psalms at the wells.&rdquo; In Hone&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>Every Day Book</i>,&rdquo; under date 1826, are the following
remarks by a correspondent:&mdash;&ldquo;Tissington
&lsquo;well-dressing&rsquo; is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>festivity which not only
claims a high antiquity, but is one of the few country f&ecirc;tes
which are kept up with anything like the ancient spirit. It is one
which is heartily loved and earnestly anticipated; one which draws the
hearts of those who were brought up there, but whom fortune has cast
into distant places, homewards with an irresistible charm. I have not
had the pleasure of witnessing it, but I have had that of seeing the
joy which sparkled in the eyes of the Tissingtonians as they talked of
its approach and of their projected attendance.&rdquo; The festival is
still held in honour at Tissington, and elaborate preparations continue
to be made for its celebration. Flowers are arranged in patterns to
form mottoes and texts of Scripture, and also devices, such as crosses,
crowns, and triangles, while green boughs are added to complete the
picture. A correspondent of &ldquo;<i>Notes and Queries</i>&rdquo; thus
describes the decorations on Ascension Day in 1887: &ldquo;The name of
&lsquo;well-dressing&rsquo; scarcely gives a proper idea of these
beautiful structures. They are rather fountains or cascades, the water
descending from above, and not rising as in a well. Their height varies
from ten to twelve feet, and the original stone frontage is on this day
hidden by a wooden erection in the form of an arch or some other
elegant design. Over these planks a layer of plaster of Paris is
spread, and whilst it is wet, flowers without leaves are stuck in it,
forming a most beautiful mosaic pattern. On one the large yellow field
ranunculus was arranged in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>letters, and so a verse of
Scripture or of a hymn was recalled to the spectator&rsquo;s mind. On
another a white dove was sculptured in the plaster and set in a
ground-work of the humble violet. The daisy, which our poet Chaucer
would gaze upon for hours together, formed a diaper-work of red and
white; the pale yellow primrose was set off by the rich red of the
&lsquo;ribes.&rsquo; Nor were the coral berries of the holly, mountain
ash, and yew forgotten; they are carefully gathered and stored in the
winter to be ready for the May Day f&ecirc;te. It is scarcely possible
to describe the vivid colouring and beautiful effect of these
favourites of nature arranged in wreaths and garlands and devices of
every hue. And then the pure sparkling water, which pours down from the
midst of them on to the rustic moss-grown stones beneath, completes the
enchantment, and makes this feast of the &lsquo;well-flowering&rsquo;
one of the most beautiful of all the old customs that are left in
Merrie England.&rdquo; Well-flowering also prevails at Buxton, and is a
source of interest to the many visitors to that airy health resort.</p>
<p>Such floral devices do not now rank as votive gifts. They are merely
decorations. The custom may have originated in the Roman Fontinalia. At
any rate it had at one time a corresponding object. The Fontinalia
formed an annual flower-festival in honour of the nymphs inhabiting
springs. Joyous bands visited the fountains, crowned them with boughs,
and threw nosegays into their sparkling water. The parallelism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>between the Roman and the English Fontinalia is
too well marked to be overlooked. In Derbyshire and Staffordshire the
ceremony of well-dressing is usually observed on Ascension Day. In more
than one instance the festival has attracted to itself various old
English sports commonly associated with May Day. Among these may be
mentioned May-pole and Morris-dancing and crowning the May-queen.</p>
<p>At Endon, in Staffordshire, the festival is celebrated on Royal Oak
Day (May 29th), or on the following day if the 29th is a Sunday. The
following account&mdash;somewhat abbreviated&mdash;is from the
&ldquo;<i>Staffordshire Evening Post</i>&rdquo; of 31st May, 1892, and
gives some interesting particulars about the festival: &ldquo;The
secluded village of Endon yesterday celebrated the well-dressing feast.
This institution, dear to the heart of every loyal inhabitant, holds
foremost rank in the local calends, for it is not a holiday of ordinary
frivolous significance, but a thanksgiving festival. The proceeds,
which generally amount to some hundreds of pounds, are divided between
the poor of the parish and the parochial schools. There are two wells
at Endon. One is very old and almost dry, and has long since fallen
into disuse. The other alone supplies the village with water. From a
very early hour in the morning the whole village was astir, and those
people who were gifted with taste and a delicate touch busied
themselves in bedecking the wells for the coming ceremony. As the day
advanced, crowds of visitors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>poured in from all parts of the
potteries; and towards evening the village green probably held no fewer
than two thousand people. The proceedings, which were under the
personal guidance of the vicar, commenced a little before two
o&rsquo;clock. A procession of about a hundred and twenty Sunday-school
children was formed at the new well, with the Brownedge village brass
band at its head. The children carried little flags, which they
vigorously waved in excess of glee. The band struck up bravely, and the
procession marched in good order up the hill to the old parish church,
where a solemn service was conducted. The villagers attended in
overwhelming numbers, and completely thronged the building. There was a
fully surpliced choir, whose singing, coupled with the music of the
organ, greatly added to the impressiveness of the service. Hymns and
psalms, selected by the vicar as applicable to a thanksgiving service
for water, were sung by the congregation in spirited style. At the
conclusion of the service the procession was reformed, the band leading
the way back to the new well. Upon arrival, the clergy and choir, who
had retained their surplices, walked slowly round the well, singing
&lsquo;Rock of Ages&rsquo; and &lsquo;A living stream as crystal
clear.&rsquo; Both wells were very beautifully decorated; but the new
well was a masterpiece of elaborated art. A large wooden framework had
been erected in front of the well, and upon this a smooth surface of
soft clay had been laid. The clay was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>thickly studded with
many thousands of flower heads in great variety of kind and hue, and in
pictorial as well as geometrical arrangement. There were two very
pretty figures of peacocks in daisies, bluebells, and dahlias, and a
resplendent motto, &lsquo;O, ye wells! bless ye the Lord!&rsquo; (from
the Benedicite) garnished the summit. The old well was almost deserted,
although its decorations were well worthy of inspection. Its motto,
&lsquo;Give me this water&rsquo; (from the fourth chapter of St. John)
was very finely traced, and its centre figures&mdash;two white doves
and a crown&mdash;were sufficiently striking. May-pole dances,
including the crowning of the May-queen, occupied the greater part of
the afternoon. In the evening the band played for dancing, and there
was a repetition of the May-pole dances. After dusk there was a display
of fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though, as already stated, well-dressing was unknown north of the
Tweed, any account of votive offerings would be incomplete without a
reference to the picturesque ceremony. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In all ages much attention has been given to the
weather, with special reference to its bearings on human well-being. As
Mr. R. Inwards truly observes, in his
&ldquo;<i>Weather-lore</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;From the earliest times
hunters, shepherds, sailors, and tillers of the earth have from sheer
necessity been led to study the teachings of the winds, the waves, the
clouds, and a hundred other objects from which the signs of coming
changes in the state of the air might be foretold. The weather-wise
amongst these primitive people would be naturally the most prosperous,
and others would soon acquire the coveted foresight by a closer
observance of the same objects from which their successful rivals
guessed the proper time to provide against a storm, or reckoned on the
prospects of the coming crops.&rdquo; Hence, naturally enough, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>weather has an important place in folklore.
Various prognostications concerning it have been drawn from sun and
moon, from animals and flowers; while certain meteorological phenomena
have, in their turn, been regarded as prophetic of mundane events.
Thus, in the astrological treatise entitled &ldquo;<i>The Knowledge of
Things Unknown</i>,&rdquo; we read that &ldquo;Thunder in January
signifieth the same year great winds, plentiful of corn and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2518" title="Source: cattel">cattle</span>
peradventure; in February, many rich men shall die in great sickness;
in March, great winds, plenty of corn, and debate amongst people; in
April, be fruitful and merry with the death of wicked men;&rdquo; and
so on through the other months of the year. One can easily understand
why thunder should be counted peculiarly ominous. The effects produced
on the mind by its mysterious noise, and on the nerves by the
electricity in the air, are apt to lead superstitious people to expect
strange events. Particular notice was taken of the weather on certain
ecclesiastical festivals, and omens were drawn from its condition.
Thus, from &ldquo;<i>The Husbandman&rsquo;s Practice</i>,&rdquo; we
learn that &ldquo;The wise and cunning masters in astrology have found
that man may see and mark the weather of the holy Christmas night, how
the whole year after shall be in his making and doing, and they shall
speak on this wise. When on the Christmas night and evening it is very
fair and clear weather, and is without wind and without rain, then it
is a token that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215"
name="pb215">215</a>]</span>this year will be plenty of wine and fruit.
But if the contrariwise, foul weather and windy, so shall it be very
scant of wine and fruit. But if the wind arise at the rising of the
sun, then it betokeneth great dearth among beasts and cattle this year.
But if the wind arise at the going down of the same, then it signifieth
death to come among kings and other great lords.&rdquo; We do not
suppose that anyone nowadays attends to such Yule-tide auguries, but
there are not wanting those who have a lingering belief in the power of
Candlemas and St. Swithin&rsquo;s Day to foretell the sort of weather
to be expected in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Witches were believed to be able to raise the wind at their
pleasure. In a confession made at Auldearn in Nairnshire, in the year
1662, certain women, accused of sorcery, said, &ldquo;When we raise the
wind we take a rag of cloth and wet it in water, and we take a beetle
and knock the rag on a stone, and we say thrice over&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;I knock this rag upon this stane,</p>
<p class="line">To raise the wind in the devil&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="line">It shall not lie until I please
again!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the wind was to be allayed the rag was dried.
About 1670 an attempt was made to drain some two thousand acres of land
belonging to the estate of Dun in Forfarshire. The Dronner&rsquo;s,
<i>i.e.</i>, Drainer&rsquo;s Dyke&mdash;remains of which are still to
be seen behind the Montrose Infirmary&mdash;was built in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>connection with the scheme. But the work was
destroyed by a terrible storm, caused, it was believed, by a certain
Meggie Cowie&mdash;the last to be burned for witchcraft in the
district. About eighty years before, a notable witch-trial in the time
of James VI. had to do with the raising of a storm. A certain woman,
Agnes Sampson, residing in Haddingtonshire, confessed that she belonged
to a company of two hundred witches, and that they were all in the
habit of sailing along the coast in sieves to meet the devil at the
kirk of North Berwick. After one of these interviews the woman took a
cat and christened it, and, after fixing to it parts of a dead
man&rsquo;s body, threw the creature into the sea in presence of the
other witches. The king, who was then returning from Denmark with his
bride, was delayed by contrary winds, and such a tempest arose in the
Firth of Forth that a vessel, containing valuable gifts for the queen
on her arrival, sank between Burntisland and Leith. The Rev. T. F.
Thiselton Dyer makes the suggestion in his &ldquo;<i>Folklore of
Shakespeare</i>,&rdquo; that it was probably to these contrary winds
that the author of &ldquo;<i>Macbeth</i>&rdquo; alludes when he makes
the witch say&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Though his bark cannot be lost,</p>
<p class="line">Yet it shall be tempest-tost.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Even down to the end of last century, and probably
later, some well-educated people believed that the devil had the power
of raising the wind. The phrase, the prince of the power of the air,
applied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>to him in Scripture, was interpreted in a
literal way. &ldquo;<i>The Diary of the Rev. John Mill</i>,&rdquo;
minister in Shetland from 1740 till 1803, bears witness to such a
belief. In his introduction to the work, the editor, Mr. Gilbert
Goudie, tells us: &ldquo;He (Mill) was often heard talking aloud with
his (to others) unseen foe; but those who heard him declared that he
spoke in an unknown tongue, presumably Hebrew. After one of these
encounters the worthy man was heard muttering, &lsquo;Well, let him do
his worst; the wind aye in my face will not hurt me.&rsquo; This was in
response to a threat of the devil, that wherever he (Mill) went, he
(Satan) should be a-blowing &lsquo;wind in his teeth,&rsquo; in
consequence of which Mill was unable ever after to get passage out of
Shetland.&rdquo; On the 5th of November, 1605, a terrible storm swept
over the north of Scotland and destroyed part of the cathedral at
Dornoch. As is well known, the day in question was selected by Guy
Fawkes for blowing up the Houses of Parliament. In his
&ldquo;<i>Cathedral of Caithness, at Dornoch</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Hugh F.
Campbell tells us: &ldquo;When the news of the gunpowder plot reached
the north, the co-incidence of time at once impressed the imagination
of a superstitious age. The storm was invested with an element of the
marvellous.&rdquo; Mr. Campbell then quotes the following curious
passage from Sir Robert Gordon, specially referring to Satan&rsquo;s
connection with the tempest:&mdash;&ldquo;The same verie night that
this execrable plott should have been put in execution <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>all
the inner stone pillars of the north syd of the body of the cathedral
church at Dornogh&mdash;lacking the rooff before&mdash;were blowen from
the verie roots and foundation quyt and clein over the outer walls of
the church: such as hath sein the same. These great winds did even then
prognosticate and forshew some great treason to be at hand; and as the
divell was busie then to trouble the ayre, so wes he bussie by these
hiss fyrebrands to trouble the estate of Great Britane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notion that storms, especially when accompanied by thunder and
lightning, were the work of evil spirits, came out prominently during
the middle ages in connection with bells. The ringing of bells was
believed to drive away the demons, and so allay the tempest. A singular
superstition concerning the causation of storms was brought to light in
Hungary during the autumn of 1892 in connection with the fear of
cholera. At Kidzaes a patient died of what was thought to be that
disease, and a <i>post mortem</i> examination was ordered by the local
authorities. Strenuous opposition, however, was offered by the
villagers on the ground that the act would cause such a hail-storm as
would destroy their crops. Feeling ran so high that a riot was
imminent, and the project had to be abandoned. Eric, the Swedish king,
could control the winds through his enchantments. By turning his cap he
was able to bring a breeze from whatever quarter he wished. Mr. G. L.
Gomme, in his &ldquo;<i>Ethnology in Folklore</i>,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>remarks, &ldquo;At Kempoch Point, in the Firth
of Clyde, is a columnar rock called the Kempoch Stane, from whence a
saint was wont to dispense favourable winds to those who paid for them,
and unfavourable to those who did not put confidence in his
powers&mdash;a tradition which seems to have been carried on by the
Innerkip witches who were tried in 1662, and some portions of which
still linger among the sailors of Greenock.&rdquo; The stone in
question consists of a block of grey mica schist six feet in height and
two in diameter. It is locally known as Granny Kempoch. In former times
sailors and fishermen sought to ensure good fortune on the sea by
walking seven times round the stone. While making their rounds they
carried in their hand a basket of sand, and at the same time uttered an
eerie chant. Newly-married couples used also to walk round the stone by
way of luck.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the present century a certain woman, Bessie
Miller by name, lived in Stromness, in Orkney, and eked out her
livelihood by selling winds to mariners. Her usual charge was sixpence.
For this sum, as Sir W. Scott tells us, &ldquo;she boiled her kettle,
and gave the barque advantage of her prayers, for she disclaimed all
unlawful arts. The wind, thus petitioned for, was sure to arrive,
though sometimes the mariners had to wait some time for it.&rdquo; Her
house was on the brow of the steep hill above the town, &ldquo;and for
exposure might have been the abode of Eolus himself.&rdquo; At the time
of Sir Walter&rsquo;s visit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>to Stromness, Bessie Miller was
nearly a hundred years old, and appeared &ldquo;withered and dried up
like a mummy.&rdquo; We make her acquaintance in the
&ldquo;<i>Pirate</i>,&rdquo; under the name of Norna of the Fitful
Head. In his &ldquo;<i>Rambles in the Far North</i>,&rdquo; Mr. R. M.
Fergusson tells of another wind-compelling personage, named Mammie
Scott, who also belonged to Stromness, and practised her arts there,
till within a comparatively recent date. &ldquo;Many wonderful tales
are told of her power and influence over the weather. Her fame was
widely spread as that of Bessie. A captain called upon Mammie one day
to solicit a fair wind. He was bound for Stornoway, and received from
the reputed witch a scarlet thread upon which were three knots. His
instructions were, that if sufficient wind did not arrive, one of the
knots was to be untied; if that proved insufficient, another knot was
to be untied; but he was on no account to unloose the third knot, else
disaster would overtake his vessel. The mariner set out upon his
voyage, and, the wind being light, untied the first knot. This brought
a stronger breeze, but still not sufficient to satisfy him. The second
knot was let down, and away the vessel sped across the waters, round
Cape Wrath. In a short time the entrance to Stornoway harbour was
reached, when it came into the captain&rsquo;s head to untie the third
knot in order to see what might occur. He was too near the end of his
voyage to suffer any damage now; and so he felt emboldened <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>to
make the experiment. No sooner was the last knot set free than a
perfect hurricane set in from a contrary direction, which drove the
vessel right back to Hoy Sound, from which she had set out, where he
had ample time to repent of his folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within the last half-century there lived in Stonehaven an old woman,
who was regarded with considerable awe by the sea-faring population.
Before a voyage it was usual to propitiate her by the gift of a bag of
coals. On one occasion, two brothers, owners of a coasting smack, after
setting sail, had to return to port through stress of weather, the
storm being due, it was believed, to the fact that one of the brothers
had omitted to secure the woman&rsquo;s good offices in the usual way.
The brother who was captain of the smack seems to have been a firm
believer in wind-charms, for it is related of him that during a more
than usually high wind he was in the habit of throwing up his cap into
the air with the exclamation, &ldquo;She maun hae something.&rdquo;
<i>She</i>, in this case, was the wind, and not the witch: and the cap
was meant as a gift to propitiate the storm. Dr. Charles Rogers, in his
&ldquo;<i>Social Life in Scotland</i>,&rdquo; tells us that &ldquo;the
seamen of Shetland, in tempestuous weather, throw a piece of money into
the window of a ruinous chapel dedicated to St. Ronald in the belief
that the saint will allay the vehemence of the storm.&rdquo; According
to the same writer, &ldquo;Shetland boatmen still purchase favourable
winds from elderly women, who pretend <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>to rule or to modify
the storms.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are now in Lerwick,&rdquo; Dr. Rogers
continues, &ldquo;several old women who in this fashion earn a
subsistence. Many of the survivors of the great storm of the 20th of
July, 1881&mdash;so fatal on northern coasts&mdash;assert that their
preservation was due to warnings which they received through a
supernatural agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Human skulls have their folklore. The lifting of them from their
usual resting-places has, in popular belief, been connected with
certain mysterious occurrences. According to a story told by Mr. Wirt
Sikes, in his &ldquo;<i>British Goblins</i>,&rdquo; a man who removed a
skull from a church to prove to his companions that he was free from
superstition was overtaken by a terrible whirlwind, the result, it was
thought, of his rash act. In some Highland districts it used to be
reckoned unlucky to allow a corpse to remain unburied. If from any
cause, human bones came to the surface, care was taken to lay them
below ground again, as otherwise disastrous storms would ensue.</p>
<p>We have a good example of the association of wind-charms with water
in the case of a certain magical stone referred to by Martin as
existing in his day in the island of Fladda, near Skye. There was a
chapel to St. Columba on the island, and on the altar lay the stone in
question. The stone was round, of a blue colour, and was always moist.
&ldquo;It is an ordinary custom,&rdquo; Martin relates, &ldquo;when any
of the fishermen are detained in the isle <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>by contrary winds, to
wash the blue stone with water all round, expecting thereby to procure
a favourable wind, which, the credulous tenant, living in the isle,
says never fails, especially if a stranger wash the stone.&rdquo; The
power of the Fladda stone was equalled by a certain well in Gigha,
though in the latter instance a dweller in the island, rather than a
stranger, had power over it. When a foreign boat was wind-bound on the
island, the master of the craft was in the habit of giving some money
to one of the natives, to procure a favourable breeze. This was done in
the following way. A few feet above the well was a heap of stones,
forming a cover to the spring. These were carefully removed, and the
well was cleared out with a wooden dish or clam-shell. The water was
then thrown several times towards the point, from which the needed wind
should blow. Certain words of incantation were used, each time the
water was thrown. After the ceremony, the stones were replaced, as the
district would otherwise have been swept by a hurricane. Pennant
mentions, in connection with his visit to Gigha, that the superstition
had then died out. In this he was in error, for the well continued to
be occasionally consulted to a later date. Even within recent years,
the memory of the practice lingered in the island; but there seemed
some doubt, as to the exact nature of the required ritual. Captain T.
P. White was told by a shepherd, belonging to the island, that, if a
stone was taken out of the well, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>a storm would arise and
prevent any person crossing over, nor would it abate till the stone was
taken back to the well.</p>
<p>From the evidence of an Irish example, we find that springs could
allay a storm, as well as produce a favourable breeze. The island of
Innismurray, off the coast of Sligo, has a sacred well called
Tobernacoragh. When a tempest was raging, the natives believed that by
draining the water of this well into the sea, the wrath of the elements
could be calmed. Mr. Gomme, in his &ldquo;<i>Ethnology in
Folklore</i>,&rdquo; when commenting on the instance, remarks,
&ldquo;In this case the connection between well-worship and the worship
of a rain-god is certain, for it may be surmised that if the emptying
of the well allayed a storm, some complementary action was practised at
one time or other in order to produce rain, and in districts more
subject to a want of rain than this Atlantic island, that ceremony
would be accentuated at the expense of the storm-allaying ceremony at
Innismurray.&rdquo; The Routing Well, at Monktown, in Inveresk parish,
Mid-Lothian, was believed to give notice of an approaching storm by
uttering sounds resembling the moaning of the wind. As a matter of
fact, the noises came from certain disused coal-workings in the
immediate neighbourhood, and were due to the high wind blowing through
them. The sounds thus <i>accompanied</i> and did not <i>precede</i> the
storm.</p>
<p>To procure rain, recourse was had to various <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>superstitious practices. Martin tells of a
stone, five feet high, in the form of a cross, opposite St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church, in North Uist. &ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;call it the &lsquo;Water Cross,&rsquo; for the ancient
inhabitants had a custom of erecting this sort of cross to procure
rain, and when they had got enough, they laid it flat on the ground,
but this custom is now disused.&rdquo; Among the mountains of British
Columbia, is a certain stone held in much honour by the Indians, for
they believe that it will produce rain when struck. Rain-making is an
important occupation among uncivilised races, and strange rites are
sometimes practised to bring about the desired result. By some savages,
human hair is burned for this end. Mr. J. G. Frazer, in &ldquo;<i>The
Golden Bough</i>,&rdquo; has some interesting remarks on
rain-production. After enumerating certain rain-charms among heathen
nations, he remarks, &ldquo;Another way of constraining the rain-god is
to disturb him in his haunts. This seems the reason why rain is
supposed to be the consequence of troubling a sacred spring. The Dards
believed that if a cowskin or anything impure is placed in certain
springs storms will follow. Gervasius mentions a spring, into which, if
a stone or a stick were thrown, rain would at once issue from it and
drench the thrower. There was a fountain in Munster such that if it
were touched or even looked at by a human being it would at once flood
the whole province with rain.&rdquo; Curious survivals of ancient
rain-charms are to be found in modern folk-customs. Thus, in connection
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>rejoicings of the harvest-home in England, when
the last load of grain was being carried on the gaily decorated
hock-cart to the farm-yard, it was customary to throw water on those
taking part in the ceremony. This apparently meaningless frolic was in
reality a rain-charm. A Cornish custom, at one time popular at Padstow
on the first of May, can be explained on the same principle. A
hobby-horse was taken to the Traitor&rsquo;s Pool, a quarter of a mile
from the town. The head was dipped in the pool, and water was sprinkled
on the bystanders.</p>
<p>Such charms depend for their efficacy on what is called
&ldquo;sympathetic magic.&rdquo; Mimic rain is produced on the earth,
in the hope that the same liquid will be constrained to descend from
the heavens, to bring fresh fertility to the fields. Professor Rhys, in
his &ldquo;<i>Celtic Heathendom</i>,&rdquo; traces the connection
between modern rain-charms and the rites of ancient paganism. He there
quotes the following particulars regarding Dulyn, in North Wales, from
a description of the place published in 1805:&mdash;&ldquo;There lies
in Snowdon Mountain a lake called Dulyn, in a dismal dingle surrounded
by high and dangerous rocks; the lake is exceedingly black, and its
fish are loathsome, having large heads and small bodies. No wild swan
or duck or any kind of bird has ever been seen to light on it, as is
their wont on every other Snowdonian lake. In this same lake there is a
row of stepping stones extending into it; and if any one steps on the
stones and throws water so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>as to wet the furthest stone of
the series, which is called the <i>Red Altar</i>, it is but a chance
that you do not get rain before night, even when it is hot
weather.&rdquo; The spot was, probably in pre-Christian times, the
scene of sacrifices to some local deity. Judging from the dismal
character of the neighbourhood, we may safely infer that fear entered
largely into the worship paid there to the <i>genius loci</i>. The
Fountain of Barenton, in Brittany, was specially celebrated in
connection with rain-making. During the early middle ages, the
peasantry of the neighbourhood resorted to it in days of drought.
According to a time-honoured custom, they took some water from the
fountain and threw it on a slab hard by; rain was the result. Professor
Rhys reminds us that this fountain &ldquo;still retains its pluvial
importance; for, in seasons of drought, the inhabitants of the
surrounding parishes, we are told go to it in procession, headed by
their five great banners and their priests ringing bells and chanting
psalms. On arriving, the rector of the canton dips the foot of the
cross in the water, and it is sure to rain within a week&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo; The Barenton instance is specially interesting, for part
of the ceremony recalls what happened in connection with a certain
Scottish spring, viz., Tobar Faolan at Struan, in Athole. This spring,
as the name implies, was dedicated to Fillan. In his &ldquo;Holiday
Notes in Athole,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; volume xii. (new series), Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>J. Mackintosh Gow says, &ldquo;It is nearly one
hundred yards west from the church, at the foot of the bank, and close
to the river Garry. It is overgrown with grass and weeds, but the water
is as clear and cool as it may have been in the days of the saint.
There is no tradition of its having been a curing or healing well,
except that in pre-Reformation days, when a drought prevailed and rain
was much wanted, an image of the saint, which was kept in the church,
used to be taken in procession to the well, and, in order that rain
might come, the feet of the image were placed in the water; and this,
of course, was generally supposed to have the desired effect.&rdquo; At
Botriphnie, in Banffshire, six miles from Keith, the wooden image of
St. Fumac used to be solemnly washed in his well on the third of May.
We may conclude that the ceremony was intended as a rain-charm. It must
have been successful, on at least one occasion, for the river Isla
became flooded through the abundance of rain. Indeed, the flooding was
so great that the saint&rsquo;s image was swept away by the rushing
water. The image was finally stranded at Banff, where it was burned as
a relic of superstition by order of the parish minister about the
beginning of the present century. In Glentham Church, Lincolnshire, is
a tomb, with a figure locally called &ldquo;Molly Grime.&rdquo; From
&ldquo;<i>Old English Customs and Charities</i>,&rdquo; we learn that,
till 1832, the figure was washed every Good Friday with water from
Newell Well by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=

shilling, &ldquo;in consequence of an old bequest connected with some
property in that district.&rdquo; Perhaps its testator was not free
from a belief in the efficacy of rain-charms. Otherwise, the ceremony
seems meaningless. If the keeping clean of the figure was the only
object, the seven old maids should not have limited their duties to an
annual pilgrimage from the well to the church. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Trees were at one time worshipped as well as
fountains. Ygdrasil, the world-tree of Scandinavian mythology, had
three roots, and underneath each, was a fountain of wonderful virtues.
This represents the connection between tree and well in the domain of
mythology. But the same superstition was connected with ordinary trees
and wells. Glancing back over the history of civilisation, we reach a
period, when vegetation was endowed with personality. As plants
manifested the phenomena of life and death like man and the lower
animals, they had a similar kind of existence attributed to them. Among
some savages to-day, the fragrance of a flower is thought to be its
soul. As there was thus no hard and fast line between man and the
vegetable kingdom, the one could be derived from the other; in other
words, men could have trees as their ancestors. Curious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>survivals of such a belief lie both revealed and
concealed in the language of to-day. Though we are far separated from
such a phase of archaic religion, we speak of the <i>branches</i> of a
family. At one time such an expression represented a literal fact, and
not a mere metaphor. In like manner, we call a son, who resembles his
father, &ldquo;a chip of the old block.&rdquo; But how few when using
the phrase are alive to its real force! Mr. Keary, in his
&ldquo;<i>Outlines of Primitive Belief</i>,&rdquo; observes,
&ldquo;Even when the literal notion of the descent from a tree had been
lost sight of, the close connection between the prosperity of the tribe
and the life of its fetish was often strictly held. The village tree of
the German races was originally a tribal tree with whose existence the
life of the village was involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picturesque ceremony known as the &ldquo;Wassailing of
Apple-trees,&rdquo; kept up till lately in Devon and Cornwall, carries
our thoughts back to the time when tree-worship was a thriving cult in
our land. It was celebrated on the evening before Epiphany (January
6th). The farmer, accompanied by his labourers, carried a pail of cider
with roasted apples in it into the orchard. The pail was placed on the
ground, and each one of the company took from it a cupful of the
liquid. They then stood before the trees and repeated the following
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Health to thee, good apple tree,</p>
<p class="line">Well to bear pocket-fulls, hat-fulls,</p>
<p class="line">Peck-fulls, bushel bag-fulls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>Part of the contents of the cup was then drunk, and the remainder
was thrown at the tree amid shouts from the by-standers. Relics of the
same cult can be traced in the superstitious regard for such trees as
the rowan, the elder, &amp;c., and in the decoration of the May-pole
and the Christmas Tree. According to an ancient Irish legend, a certain
spring in Erin, called Connla&rsquo;s Well, had growing over it nine
mystical hazel trees. Year by year these trees produced their flowers
and fruit simultaneously. The nuts were of a brilliant crimson colour
and contained in some mysterious way the knowledge of all that was best
in poetry and art. Professor O&rsquo;Curry, in his &ldquo;<i>Lectures
on the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish</i>,&rdquo; refers to
this legend, and says, &ldquo;No sooner were the beautiful nuts
produced on the trees than they always dropped into the well, raising
by their fall a succession of shining red bubbles. Now, during this
time the water was always full of salmon, and no sooner did the bubbles
appear than these salmon darted to the surface and ate the nuts, after
which they made their way to the river. The eating of the nuts produced
brilliant crimson spots on the bellies of these salmon, and to catch
and eat these salmon became an object of more than mere gastronomic
interest among those who were anxious to become distinguished in the
arts and in literature without being at the pains and delay of long
study, for the fish was supposed to have become filled with the
knowledge which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233"
name="pb233">233</a>]</span>was contained in the nuts, which, it was
believed, would be transferred in full to those who had the good
fortune to catch and eat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In many cases it was counted unlucky to cut down trees, since the
spirits, inhabiting them, would resent the injury. In the sixteenth
century the parishioners of Clynnog, in Caernarvonshire, refrained from
destroying the trees growing in the grounds of St. Beyno. Even though
he was their patron saint, he was quite ready to harm anybody who took
liberties with his grove. Loch Siant Well, in Skye, was noted for its
power to cure headaches, stitches, and other ailments, and was much
frequented in consequence. Martin says, &ldquo;There is a small coppice
near to the well, and there is none of the natives dare venture to cut
the least branch of it for fear of some signal judgment to follow upon
it.&rdquo; Martin also tells us that the same reverence was for long
paid to the peat on the island of Lingay. This island, he says,
&ldquo;is singular in respect of all the lands of Uist, and the other
islands that surround it, for they are all composed of sand, and this,
on the contrary, is altogether moss covered with heath, affording five
peats in depth, and is very serviceable and useful, furnishing the
island Borera, &amp;c., with plenty of good fuel. This island was held
as consecrated for several ages, insomuch that the natives would not
then presume to cut any fuel in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When trees beside wells had rags hung on them as offerings, they
would naturally be reverenced, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>the living altars for the
reception of the gifts. But even when not used for this purpose, they
were sometimes thought to have a mysterious connection with the springs
they overshadowed. In the parish of Monzie, Perthshire, is a mineral
well held in much esteem till about the year 1770. At that time two
trees, till then the guardians of the spring, fell, and with their fall
its virtue departed. On the right bank of the Clyde, about
three-quarters of a mile from Carmyle village, is the once sylvan
district of Kenmuir. There, at the foot of a bank, is a spring locally
known as &ldquo;The Marriage Well,&rdquo; the name being derived, it is
said, from two curiously united trees beside its margin. These trees
were recently cut down. In former times, it was customary for marriage
parties, the day after their wedding, to visit the spring, and there
pledge the bride and bridegroom in draughts of its sparkling water. On
the banks of the Kelvin, close to the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, once
flowed a spring styled the Pear-Tree, Pea-Tree, or Three-Tree Well, the
last name being probably the original one. In former times it was a
recognised trysting-place for lovers. A tragic story is told in
connection with it by Mr. James Napier in his &ldquo;<i>Notes and
Reminiscences of Partick</i>.&rdquo; A maiden, named Catherine Clark,
arranged to meet her lover there by night,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e2701">&ldquo;nor did she ever dream</p>
<p class="line">But that he was what he did ever seem.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She never returned to her home. &ldquo;A few days
after,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>remarks Mr. Napier, &ldquo;her body was found
buried near a large tree which stood within a few yards of the Pea-Tree
Well. This tree was afterwards known as &lsquo;Catherine Clark&rsquo;s
Tree,&rsquo; and remained for many years an object of interest to the
visitors to this far-famed well, and many a sympathising lover carved
his name in rude letters on its bark. But the tree was also an object
of terror to those who had to pass it in dark and lonely nights, and
many tales were told of people who had seen a young female form dressed
in white, and stained with blood, standing at the tree foot.&rdquo; The
tree was removed many years ago. The spring too is gone, the recent
extension of the Caledonian Railway to Maryhill having forced it to
quit the field.</p>
<p>Near the moat of Listerling, in county Kilkenny, Ireland, is a holy
well dedicated to St. Mullen, who is said to have lived for a while in
its neighbourhood. A fine hawthorn, overshadowing it, grew&mdash;if we
can believe a local legend&mdash;from the staff of the saint, which he
there stuck into the ground. This reminds one of the famous Glastonbury
Thorn, produced from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea, who fixed it in
the ground one Christmas Day. The staff took root at once, put forth
branches, and next day was covered with milk-white blossoms. St.
Servanus&rsquo;s staff, too, had a miraculous ending. He threw it
across the Firth of Forth, and when it fell on the Fife coast, it took
root and became an apple-tree. A group of thorn-bushes, near Aghaboe,
in Queen&rsquo;s County, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>Ireland, was dedicated to St.
Canice. The spring, overshadowed by them, was much resorted to for the
purposes of devotion. At Rearymore, in the same county, some hawthorns,
growing beside St. Finyan&rsquo;s spring, were, and doubtless still
are, religiously preserved by the natives. In the Isle of Man is
Chibber Unjin, signifying The Well of the Ash. Beside it grew an ash
tree, formerly decorated with votive offerings.</p>
<p>What has been called the <i>external soul</i> has an important place
in folklore, and forms the theme of many folk-tales. Primitive man does
not think of the soul as spiritual, but as material&mdash;as something
that can be seen and felt. It can take different shapes. It can leave
the body during sleep, and wander about in the guise of an animal, such
as a mouse. Considerable space is devoted to this problem in Mr. J. G.
Frazer&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Golden Bough</i>.&rdquo; Mr. Frazer there
remarks, &ldquo;There may be circumstances in which, if the life or
soul remains in the man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining
injury than if it were stowed away in some safe and secret place.
Accordingly, in such circumstances, primitive man takes his soul out of
his body and deposits it for security in some safe place, intending to
replace it in his body when the danger is past; or, if he should
discover some place of absolute security, he may be content to leave
his soul there permanently. The advantage of this is, that so long as
the soul remains unharmed in the place where he has deposited it, the
man himself is immortal; nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>can kill his body, since his
life is not in it.&rdquo; Sometimes the soul is believed to be stowed
away in a tree, injury to the latter involving disaster to the former.
The custom of planting trees, and calling them after certain persons
may nowadays have nothing to do with this notion; but, undoubtedly, a
real connection was at one time believed to exist between the partners
in the transaction. A certain oak, with mistletoe growing on it, was
mysteriously associated with the family of Hay. The superstition is
explained in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;While the mistletoe bats on Errol&rsquo;s
oak</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">And that oak stands fast,</p>
<p class="line">The Hays shall flourish, and their good grey hawk</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">Shall not flinch before the blast.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">But when the root of the oak decays</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">And the mistletoe dwines on its withered
breast,</p>
<p class="line">The grass shall grow on the Earl&rsquo;s
hearthstone,</p>
<p class="line xd26e725">And the corbies craw in the falcon&rsquo;s
nest.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">At Finlarig Castle, near Killin, in Perthshire, are
several trees, believed to be linked with the lives of certain
individuals, connected by family ties with the ruined fortress. Aubrey
gives an example of this superstition, as it existed in England in the
seventeenth century. He says, &ldquo;I cannot omit taking notice of the
great misfortune in the family of the Earl of Winchelsea, who, at
Eastwell, in Kent, felled down a most curious grove of oaks near his
own noble seat, and gave the first blow with his own hands. Shortly
after, the countess died in her bed suddenly, and his eldest son, the
Lord Maidstone, was killed at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238"
href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>sea by a cannon
bullet.&rdquo; In the grounds of Dalhousie Castle, about two miles from
Dalkeith, on the edge of a fine spring is the famous Edgewell Oak. Sir
Walter Scott, in his &ldquo;<i>Journal</i>,&rdquo; under date May 13th,
1829, writes, &ldquo;Went with the girls to dine at Dalhousie Castle,
where we were very kindly received. I saw the Edgewell Tree, too fatal,
says Allan Ramsay, to the family from which he was himself
descended.&rdquo; According to a belief in the district, a branch fell
from this tree, before the death of a member of the family. The
original oak fell early in last century, but a new one sprang from the
old root. An editorial note to the above entry in the
&ldquo;<i>Journal</i>&rdquo; gives the following
information:&mdash;&ldquo;The tree is still flourishing (1889), and the
belief in its sympathy with the family is not yet extinct, as an old
forester, on seeing a branch fall from it on a quiet still day in July,
1874, exclaimed, &lsquo;The laird&rsquo;s deed, noo!&rsquo; and,
accordingly, news came soon after that Fox Maule, eleventh Earl of
Dalhousie, had died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>external soul</i> was sometimes associated with objects other
than living trees. Dr. Charles Rogers tells us that &ldquo;a pear,
supposed to have been enchanted by Hugh Gifford, Lord of Yester, a
notable magician in the reign of Alexander III., is preserved in the
family of Brown of Colston, as heirs of Gifford&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;
The prosperity of the family is believed to be linked with the
preservation of the pear. Even an inanimate object would serve the
purpose. The glass drinking-cup, known as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>&ldquo;Luck of Edenhall,&rdquo; is connected
with the fortunes of the Musgrave family, and great care is taken to
preserve it from injury. Tradition says that a company of fairies were
making merry beside a spring near the mansion-house, but that, being
frightened by some intruder, they vanished, leaving the cup in
question, while one of them exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If this cup should break or fall,</p>
<p class="line">Farewell the luck of Edenhall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Some living object, however, either vegetable or
animal, was the usual repository of the <i>external soul</i>. A
familiar folk-tale tells of a giant whose heart was in a swan, and who
could not be killed while the swan lived. Hunting was a favourite
occupation among the inhabitants of the Western Isles; but on the
mountain Finchra, in Rum, no deer was killed by any member of the
Lachlan family, as it was believed that the life of that family was in
some way linked with the life of these animals. A curious superstition
is mentioned by Camden in his &ldquo;<i>Britannia</i>.&rdquo; In a pond
near the Abbey of St. Maurice, in Burgundy, were put as many fish as
there were monks. When any monk was taken ill, one of the fish was seen
to float half-dead on the surface of the pond. If the fish died the
monk died too, the death of the former giving warning of the fate of
the latter. In this case the <i>external soul</i> was thought of as
stowed away in a fish. As is well known, the Arms of the City of
Glasgow are a bell, a tree, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>fish with a ring in its
mouth, and a bird. The popular explanation of these emblems connects
them with certain miracles, wrought by Kentigern, the patron saint of
the burgh. May we not hold that an explanation of their symbolism is to
be sought in a principle, that formed an article in the beliefs of men,
long before Kentigern was born, as well as during his time and since?
The bell, it is true, had, doubtless, an ecclesiastical association;
but the other three symbols point, perhaps, to some superstitious
notion like the above. In various folk-tales, as well as in Christian
art, the soul is sometimes typified by a bird. As we have just seen, it
has been associated with trees and fish. We are entitled therefore to
ask whether the three symbols may not express one and the same idea
under different forms. It is, of course, open to anyone to say that
there were fish in the river, on whose banks Kentigern took up his
abode, and quite a forest with birds singing in it around his cell, and
that no further explanation of the symbolism need be sought. All these,
it is true, existed within the saint&rsquo;s environment, but may they
not have been regarded as types of the soul under the guise of objects
familiar to all, and afterwards grouped together in the burgh Arms? On
this hypothesis, the symbols have survived the belief that gave them
birth, and serve to connect the practical life of to-day, with the
vague visions and crude conjectures of the past. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have already seen that in early times water was an
object of worship. Stones also were reverenced as the embodiments of
nature-deities. &ldquo;In Western Europe during the middle ages,&rdquo;
remarks Sir J. Lubbock in his &ldquo;<i>Origin of
Civilisation</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;we meet with several denunciations of
stone-worship, proving its deep hold on the people. Thus the worship of
stones was condemned by Theodoric, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the
seventh century, and is among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>the acts of heathenism
forbidden by King Edgar in the tenth, and by Cnut in the eleventh
century.&rdquo; Even as late as the seventeenth century, the Presbytery
of Dingwall sought to suppress, among other practices of heathen
origin, that of rendering reverence to stones, the stones in question
having been consulted as to future events. It is not surprising
therefore that stones had certain mysterious properties ascribed to
them. In all ages precious stones have been deservedly admired for
their beauty, but, in addition, they have frequently been esteemed for
their occult qualities. &ldquo;In my youth,&rdquo; Mr. James Napier
tells us, in his &ldquo;<i>Folklore in the West of Scotland</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;there was a belief in the virtue of precious stones, which added
a value to them beyond their real value as ornaments&#8202;&hellip;.
Each stone had its own symbolic meaning and its own peculiar influence
for imparting good and protecting from evil and from sickness its
fortunate possessor.&rdquo; By the ancient Jews, the topaz and the
amethyst were believed to guard their wearers respectively against
poison and drunkenness; while the diamond was prized as a protection
against Satanic influence. Concerning the last-mentioned gem, Sir John
Mandeville, writing about 1356, says, &ldquo;It makes a man stronger
and firmer against his enemies, heals him that is lunatic, and those
whom the fiend pursues and torments.&rdquo; By certain sects of the
Gnostics, precious stones were much thought of as talismans. Among the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>sect founded by Basilides of Egypt, the famous
Abraxas gems were used as tokens by the initiated. The Gnostics also
placed gems inscribed with mystic mottoes in sarcophagi, to remind the
dead of certain prayers that were thought likely to aid them in the
other world. In Scandinavia, warriors were in the habit of carrying
about with them amulets called life-stones or victory-stones. These
strengthened the hand of the wearer in fight. In our own country, the
use of amulets was not uncommon. A flat oval-shaped pebble, measuring
two and a half inches in greatest diameter, was presented in 1864 to
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. It had been worn as a charm by
a Forfarshire farmer, who died in 1854 at the age of <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2800" title="Source: eight-four">eighty-four</span>. When in
use, it had been kept in a small bag and suspended by a red string
round the wearer&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Even when stones were not used as amulets, they were sometimes held
in superstitious regard. When in Mull, Martin was told of a yellow
stone, lying at the bottom of a certain spring in the island, its
peculiarity being that it did not get hot, though kept over the fire
for a whole day. The same writer alludes to a certain stone in Arran,
called Baul Muluy, <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Molingus, his Stone
Globe.&rdquo; It was green in colour, and was about the size of a
goose&rsquo;s egg. The stone was used by the islanders, when great
oaths had to be sworn. It was also employed to disperse an enemy. When
thrown among the front ranks, the opposing army would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>retreat in confusion. In this way the Macdonalds
were said to have gained many a victory. When not in use, the Baul
Muluy was carefully kept wrapped up in cloth. Among oath-stones, the
<i>black stones</i> of Iona were specially famous. These were situated
to the west of St. Martin&rsquo;s Cross, and were called black, not
from their colour&mdash;for they were grey&mdash;but from the effects
of perjury in the event of a false oath being sworn by them. Macdonald,
Lord of the Isles, knelt on them, and, with uplifted hands, swore that
he would never recall the rights granted by him to his vassals. Such a
hold had these oath-stones taken on the popular imagination, that when
anyone expressed himself certain about a particular thing, he gave
weight to his affirmation, by saying that he was prepared to
&ldquo;swear upon the black stones.&rdquo; Bishop Pocoke mentions that
the inhabitants of Iona &ldquo;were in the habit of breaking off pieces
from a certain stone lying in the church,&rdquo; to be used &ldquo;as
medicine for man or beast in most disorders, and especially the
flux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charm-stones were sometimes associated with early saints. The
following particulars about St. Declan&rsquo;s Stone are given by Sir
Arthur Mitchell in the tenth volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;We are told
in the life of St. Declan that a small stone was sent to him from
Heaven while he was saying Mass in a church in Italy. It came through
the window and rested on the altar. It was called Duivhin Deaglain or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>Duivh-mhion Deaglain, <i>i.e.</i>,
&lsquo;Declan&rsquo;s Black Relic.&rsquo; It performed many miracles
during his life, being famous for curing sore eyes, headaches, &amp;c.;
and is said to have been found in his grave sometime, I think, during
last century. Its size is two and a-fourth by one and three-fourth
inches, and on one side there is a Latin cross, incised and looped at
the top. At the bottom of the stem of this cross there is another small
Latin cross. On the other side of the stone there is a circle, one and
a-fourth inch in diameter, and six holes or pits.&rdquo; Curing stones
are still used occasionally in connection with the diseases of cattle,
particularly in Highland districts; but they have ceased to do duty in
the treatment of human ailments. Mary Queen of Scots seems to have been
a firm believer in their efficacy. In a letter to her brother-in-law,
Henry the Third of France, written on the eve of her execution, the
Queen says, &ldquo;She ventures to send him two rare stones, valuable
for the health, which she hopes will be good, with a happy and long
life, asking him to receive them as the gift of his very affectionate
sister-in law, who is at the point of death, and in token of true love
towards him.&rdquo; In a case of curiosities at Abbotsford, there is an
amulet that belonged to Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s mother. It somewhat
resembles crocodile skin in colour, and has a setting of silver. The
amulet was believed to prevent children from being bewitched.</p>
<p>It is nowadays difficult to ascertain the whereabouts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>of
curing-stones in the Highlands, owing to the reticence of those who
still have faith in their virtues. Till lately there was one in the
neighbourhood of Aberfeldy that had been in use, it is believed, for
about three hundred years. In shape, the charm somewhat resembled a
human heart, and consisted of a water-worn pebble fully three inches in
greatest length. When required for the cure of cattle, it was rubbed
over the affected part or was dipped in water, the water being then
given to the animal to drink. Recently the family who owned it became
extinct, and the charm passed into other hands. Martin gives some
curious information with regard to the employment of charm-stones,
among the inhabitants of the Western Isles. After describing a certain
kind of stone, called <i>lapis ceranius</i>, found in the island of
Skye, he remarks, &ldquo;These stones are by the natives called
&lsquo;Cramp-stones,&rsquo; because (as they say) they cure the cramp
in cows by washing the part affected with water in which this stone had
been steeped for some hours.&rdquo; He mentions also, that in the same
island, the stone called <i>lapis hecticus</i> was deemed efficacious
in curing consumption and other diseases. It was made red-hot, and then
cooled in milk or water, the liquid being drunk by the patient. On
Bernera, the islanders frequently rub their breasts with a particular
stone, by way of prevention, and say it is a good preservative for
health. Martin adds, &ldquo;This is all the medicine they use:
Providence is very favourable to them in granting them a good
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>state of health, since they have no physician
among them.&rdquo; In connection with his visit to the island of Rona,
the same writer observes, &ldquo;There is a chapel here dedicated to
St. Ronan, fenced with a stone wall round; and they take care to keep
it neat and clean, and sweep it every day. There is an altar in it, on
which there lies a big plank of wood, about ten feet in length; every
foot has a hole in it, and in every hole a stone, to which the natives
ascribe several virtues: one of them is singular, as they say, for
promoting speedy delivery to a woman in travail.&rdquo; The blue stone
in Fladda, already referred to in connection with wind-charms, did duty
as an oath-stone, and likewise as a curing-stone, its special function
being to remove stitches in the side. The Baul Muluy in Arran, alluded
to above, also cured stitches in the side. When the patient would not
recover, the stone withdrew from the bed of its own accord.</p>
<p>A certain white stone, taken by Columba from the river Ness, near
what is now the town of Inverness, had the singular power of becoming
invisible, when the illness of the person requiring it would prove
fatal. The selection of this stone was made in connection with the
saint&rsquo;s visit to the court of Brude, king of the Picts, about the
year 563. Adamnan, who tells the story, thus describes an interview
between Columba and Brochan (the king&rsquo;s chief Druid or Magus),
concerning the liberation of a female slave belonging to the latter:
&ldquo;The venerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248"
name="pb248">248</a>]</span>man, from motives of humanity, besought
Brochan the Druid to liberate a certain Irish female captive, a request
which Brochan harshly and obstinately refused to grant. The saint then
spoke to him as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Know, O Brochan, know, that if
you refuse to set this captive free, as I advise you, you shall die
before I return from this province.&rsquo; Having said this in presence
of Brude the king, he departed from the royal palace, and proceeded to
the river Nesa, from which he took a white pebble, and, showing it to
his companions, said to them:&mdash;&lsquo;Behold this white pebble, by
which God will effect the cure of many diseases.&rsquo; Having thus
spoken, he added, &lsquo;Brochan is punished grievously at this moment,
for an angel sent from heaven, striking him severely, has broken in
pieces the glass cup which he held in his hands, and from which he was
in the act of drinking, and he himself is left
half-dead.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Messengers were sent by the king to
announce the illness of Brochan, and to ask Columba to cure him.
Adamnan continues:&mdash;&ldquo;Having heard these words of the
messengers, Saint Columba sent two of his companions to the king with
the pebble which he had blessed, and said to them:&mdash;&lsquo;If
Brochan shall first promise to free his captive, immerse this little
stone in water, and let him drink from it; but if he refuse to liberate
her, he will that instant die.&rsquo; The two persons sent by the saint
proceeded to the palace, and announced the words of the holy man to the
king and to Brochan, an announcement which filled them with such fear
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>he immediately liberated the captive and
delivered her to the saint&rsquo;s messengers. The stone was then
immersed in water, and, in a wonderful manner and contrary to the laws
of nature, it floated on the water like a nut or an apple, nor could it
be submerged. Brochan drank from the stone as it floated on the water,
and instantly recovered his perfect health and soundness of
body.&rdquo; The wonderful pebble was kept by King Brude among his
treasures. On the day of the king&rsquo;s death, it remained true to
itself, for, when its aid was sought, it could nowhere be found.</p>
<p>According to a tradition current in Sutherland, Loch Manaar in
Strathnaver was connected with another white pebble, endowed with
miraculous properties. The tradition, as narrated by the Rev. Dr.
Gregor in the &ldquo;<i>Folklore Journal</i>&rdquo; for 1888, is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Once upon a time, in Strathnaver, there lived a
woman who was both poor and old. She was able to do many wonderful
things by the power of a white stone which she possessed, and which had
come to her by inheritance. One of the Gordons of Strathnaver having a
thing to do, wished to have both her white stone and the power of it.
When he saw that she would not lend it, or give it up, he determined to
seize her, and to drown her in a loch. The man and the woman struggled
there for a long time, till he took up a heavy stone with which to kill
her. She plunged into the lake, throwing her magic stone before her and
crying, &lsquo;May it do good to all created things save a Gordon of
Strathnaver!&rsquo; He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=
"#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>stoned her to death in the water,
she crying, &lsquo;Manaar! Manaar!&rsquo; (Shame! Shame!). And the loch
is called the Loch of Shame to this day.&rdquo; The loch had a more
than local fame, for invalids resorted to it from Orkney in the north
and Inverness in the south: its water was deemed specially efficacious
on the first Monday of February, May, August, and November, (O. S.).
The second and third of these dates were the most popular. The patient
was kept bound and half-starved for about a day previous, and
immediately after sunset on the appointed day, he was taken into the
middle of the loch and there dipped. His wet clothes were then
exchanged for dry ones, and his friends took him home in the full
expectation of a cure. Belief in the loch&rsquo;s powers was
acknowledged till recently, and is probably still secretly cherished in
the district.</p>
<p>In a graveyard beside Loch Torridon, in Ross-shire, is a spring,
formerly believed to work cures. From time immemorial three stones have
been whirling in the well, and it was usual to carry one of these in a
bucket of water to the invalid who simply touched the stone. When put
back into the well, the stone began to move round and round as before.
On one occasion a woman sought to cure her sick goat in the usual way,
but the pebble evidently did not care to minister to any creature lower
than man, for when replaced in the well, it lay motionless at the
bottom ever afterwards. A certain Katherine Craigie, who was burned as
a witch in Orkney in 1643, used <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251"
href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>pebbles in connection with
the magical cures wrought by her. Her method, as described by Dr.
Rogers in his &ldquo;<i>Social Life in Scotland</i>,&rdquo; was as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Into water wherewith she washed the patient she
placed three small stones; these, being removed from the vessel, were
placed on three corners of the patient&rsquo;s house from morning till
night, when they were deposited at the principal entrance. Next morning
the stones were cast into water with which the sick person was
anointed. The process was repeated every day till a cure was
effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At some wells, what the water lacked in the matter of efficacy was
supplied by certain stones lying by their margins. These stones, in
virtue of a real or fancied resemblance to parts of the human
body&mdash;such as the eye or arm&mdash;were applied to the members
corresponding to them in shape, in the expectation that this would
conduce to a cure. At Killin, in Perthshire, there are several stones
dedicated to Fillan, at one time much used in the way described. These
are, however, not beside a spring, but in the mill referred to in a
previous chapter. They lie in a niche in the inner wall, and have been
there from an unknown past. Whenever a new mill was built to replace
the old one, a niche was made in the wall for their reception. They are
some seven or eight in number. The largest of them weighs eight lbs.
ten oz. Special interest attaches to at least two of them, on account
of certain markings on one side, consisting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>of
shallow rounded hollows somewhat resembling the cup-marks which have
proved such a puzzle to arch&aelig;ologists. There is reason to believe
that the stones in question were at one time used in connection with
milling operations, the hollows being merely the sockets where the
spindle of the upper millstone revolved. On the saint&rsquo;s day (the
ninth of January), it was customary till not very long ago, for the
villagers to assemble at the mill, and place a layer of straw below the
stones. This custom has a particular interest, for we find a
counterpart to it in Scandinavia, both instances being clearly
survivals of stone-worship. &ldquo;In certain mountain districts of
Norway,&rdquo; Dr. Tylor tells us in his &ldquo;<i>Primitive
Culture</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;up to the end of the last century, the
peasants used to preserve round stones, washed them every Thursday
evening (which seems to show that they represented Thor), smeared them
with butter before the fire, laid them on the seat of honour on fresh
straw, and at certain times of the year steeped them in ale, that they
might bring luck and comfort to the house.&rdquo; The ritual here is
more elaborate than in the case of the Killin stones; but the instances
are parallel as regards the use of straw. Fully a couple of miles from
Killin, below Mornish, close to Loch Tay, is the lonely nettle-covered
graveyard of Cladh Davi, and on a tombstone in its enclosure lie two
roundish stones, believed to belong to the same series as those in the
mill, and marked with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href=
"#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>similar hollows. These stones were
thought to cure pectoral inflammation, the hollows being filled with
water, and applied to the breasts. The Rev. Dr. Hugh MacMillan, after
describing the stones in the volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>&rdquo; for 1883&ndash;84,
mentions that &ldquo;not long since, a woman, who was thus afflicted,
came a considerable distance, from the head of Glen Lochay, to make use
of this remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charm-stones were sometimes kept on the altars of ancient churches,
as in the case of St. Ronan&rsquo;s Chapel, and the church in Iona
already referred to. At other times they were associated with crosses.
Sir Arthur Mitchell tells of an Irish curing-stone in shape like a
dumb-bell, preserved in Killaghtee parish, County Donegal. &ldquo;There
is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a fragment of a stone cross on the top of a
small cairn. In a cleft or hollow of this cross is kept a famous
healing stone, in whose virtues there is still a belief. It is
frequently removed to houses in which sickness exists, but it is
invariably brought back, and those living near the cross can always
tell where it is to be found, if it has been so removed.<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2870" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Pennant, in
connection with his visit to Iona, speaks of certain stones lying in
the pedestal of a cross to the north-west of St. Oran&rsquo;s Chapel.
&ldquo;Numbers who visit this island,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;think
it incumbent on them to turn each of these thrice round, according to
the course of the sun. They are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>called
Clach-a-brath&mdash;for it is thought that the brath, or &lsquo;end of
the world,&rsquo; will not arrive till the stone on which they stand is
worn through.&rdquo; Pennant thought that these stones were the
successors of &ldquo;three noble globes of white marble,&rdquo; which,
according to Sacheverel, at one time lay in three stone basins, and
were turned round in the manner described, but were afterwards thrown
into the sea by the order of the ecclesiastical authorities. MacCulloch
says that, in his day, the superstition connected with the
Clach-a-brath had died out in Iona. We do not think that this was
likely. Anyhow he mentions that &ldquo;the boys of the village still
supply a stone for every visitor to turn round on its bed; and thus, in
the wearing of this typical globe, to contribute his share to the final
dissolution of all things.&rdquo; MacCulloch alludes to the same
superstition as then existing on one of the Garveloch Isles. Sometimes
hollows were made on the pedestals of crosses, not for the reception of
stone-balls, but to supply occupation to persons undergoing penance. A
sculptured cross at Kilberry, in Argyllshire, has a cavity of this kind
in its pedestal. In connection with his visit to Kilberry, Captain
White was told that &ldquo;one of the prescribed acts of penance in
connection with many of the ancient Irish crosses required the
individual under discipline, while kneeling before the cross, to scoop
out a cavity in the pedestal, pestle-and-mortar fashion; and that such
cavities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>where now to be seen, show in this way, varying
stages of the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the wonders of Harris, when Martin visited the island, was a
lunar stone lying in a hole in a rock. Like the tides, it felt the
moon&rsquo;s influence, for it advanced and retired according to the
increase or decrease of that luminary. Perforated stones were formerly
much esteemed as amulets. If a stone, with a hole in it, was tied to
the key of a stable-door, it would prevent the witches from stealing
the horses. Pre-historic relics of this kind were much used to ward off
malign influences from cattle, or to cure diseases caused by the
fairies. Ure, in his &ldquo;<i>History of Rutherglen and
Kilbride</i>,&rdquo; refers to a ring of black schistus found in a
cairn in the parish of Inchinnan. It was believed to work wonderful
cures. About a hundred years ago, a flat reddish stone, having notches
and with two holes bored through it, was presented to the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland. It came from Islay, and had been used there as
a charm. It belonged to the Stone Age, and had, doubtless, served its
first possessor as a personal ornament. Ivory had magical properties
attributed to it. The famous &ldquo;Barbeck&rsquo;s
Bone&rdquo;&mdash;once the property of the Campbells of Barbeck, in
Craignish parish, Argyllshire, and now in the National Museum of
Antiquities&mdash;is a piece of ivory seven inches long, four broad,
and half an inch thick. At one time it had a great reputation in the
West Highlands for the cure of insanity. It was counted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>so
valuable that, when it was lent, a deposit of one hundred pounds
sterling had to be made.</p>
<p>The antiquarian objects, popularly called <i>adder-beads</i>,
<i>serpent stones</i>, or <i>druidical beads</i>, were frequently used
for the cure of cattle. The beads were dipped in water, and the liquid
was then given to the animals to drink. These relics of a
long-forgotten past have been found from time to time in ancient places
of sepulture, and as they usually occur singly, it has been conjectured
that they were placed there as amulets. &ldquo;Many of them,&rdquo;
remarks Sir Daniel Wilson in his &ldquo;<i>Pre-historic
Annals</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;are exceedingly beautiful, and are
characterised by considerable ingenuity in the variations of style.
Among those in the Scottish Museum there is one of red glass spotted
with white; another of dark brown glass streaked with yellow; others of
pale green and blue glass, plain and ribbed; and two of curiously
figured patterns, wrought with various colours interwoven on their
surface.&rdquo; A fine specimen of this species of amulet was
discovered in a grave mound at Eddertoun, in Ross-shire, during the
progress of the railway operations in 1864. The Rev. Dr. Joass, who
interested himself in the antiquarian discoveries then made, thus
describes the find:&mdash;&ldquo;The glass, of which this bead was
composed, was of a dark blue colour, and but partially transparent. It
was ornamented by three volutes, which sufficed to surround it. These
were traced in a yellow pigment (or enamel) as hard as the glass
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>and seeming to sink slightly below the surface
into the body of the bead, as could be seen where this was flattened,
as if by grinding at the opposite ends of its orifice.&rdquo; These
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2902" title=
"Source: adderbeads">adder-beads</span></i> seem to have been common in
the seventeenth century. Edward Llwyd, who visited Scotland in 1699,
saw fifty different forms of them between Wales and the Scottish
Highlands. Crystal balls, he tells us, were frequently put into a tub
of water on May Day, the contents of the tub being sprinkled over
cattle to keep them from being bewitched.</p>
<p>Flint arrow-heads&mdash;the weapons of early times&mdash;became the
amulets of a later age. In folklore they are known as elf-bolts.
Popular credulity imagined that they were used by the fairies for the
destruction of cattle. When an animal was attacked by some sudden and
mysterious disease, it was believed to be &ldquo;elf-shot&rdquo; even
though no wound could be seen on its body. To cure the cow, the usual
method was to make it drink some water in which an elf-bolt had been
dipped, on the principle of taking a hair of the dog that bit you.
Elf-arrows were at one time thought to be serviceable to man also. The
custom was not unknown of sewing one of them in some part of the dress
as a charm against the influence of the evil eye. Occasionally one
still sees them doing duty as brooches, and in that form, if not now
prized as amulets, they are esteemed as ornaments.</p>
<p>Sir J. Y. Simpson, in his &ldquo;<i>Arch&aelig;ological
Essays</i>,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258"
name="pb258">258</a>]</span>gives some interesting particulars about
two ancient charm-stones, the property of two Highland families for
many generations. Of these, the Clach-na-Bratach, or Stone of the
Standard, belongs to the head of the Clan Donnachie. It is described as
&ldquo;a transparent, globular mass of rock crystal of the size of a
small apple. Its surface has been artificially polished.&rdquo; The
stone was picked up by the then chief of the clan shortly before the
battle of Bannockburn. It was found in a clod of earth adhering to the
standard when drawn out of the ground, and on account of its brilliancy
the chief foretold a victory. In later times it was used to predict the
fortunes of the clan. We are told that before the battle of
Sheriffmuir, in 1715, which proved so disastrous to the cause of the
Stuarts, as well as to that of Clan Donnachie, the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2914" title="Source: Clan-na-Bratach">Clach-na-Bratach</span>
was found to have a flaw, not seen till then. When wanted to impart
curative virtue to water, the Clach-na-Bratach was dipped in it thrice
by the hand of the chief. The other charm-stone alluded to is the Clach
Dearg, or Stone of Ardvoirlich. It resembles the Clach-na-Bratach in
appearance, though it is somewhat smaller in size. It differs from it,
moreover, in being surrounded by four silver bands of eastern
workmanship. The charm has belonged to the family of Ardvoirlich from
an unknown past, but there is no tradition as to its early history. As
a healing agent it has had more than a local fame. When its help was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>sought certain rules had to be attended to. The
person coming to Ardvoirlich was required to draw the water himself,
and bring it into the house in the vessel in which the charm was to be
dipped. A bottle of this water was then carried to the invalid&rsquo;s
home. If the bearer called at any house by the way, it was requisite
that the bottle should be left outside, otherwise the water would lose
its power.</p>
<p>In the mansion-house of Lee, some three miles north of Lanark, is
kept the Lee Penny, an amulet of even greater fame than the
Clach-na-Bratach or the Clach Dearg. This charm&mdash;the prototype of
Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Talisman</i>&rdquo;&mdash;is a
semi-transparent gem of a dark red colour. It is set in a silver coin,
believed to be a groat of Edward the Fourth. In shape it rudely
resembles a heart. This circumstance doubtless strengthened the
original belief in its magical powers, if, indeed, it did not give rise
to it. The tradition is, that Sir Simon Lockhart, an ancestor of the
present owner of the estate, left Scotland along with Sir James
Douglas, in the year 1330, to convey the heart of Robert Bruce to the
Holy Land. Douglas was killed in Spain in a battle with the Moors, and
Sir Simon returned to Scotland, bringing the heart with him. He had
various adventures in connection with this mission. One of these was
the capture of a Saracen prince, who, however, obtained his freedom for
a large sum. While the money was being counted out the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>amulet in question accidentally fell into the
heap of coin, and was claimed as part of the ransom. Previous to its
appearance in Scotland it had been much esteemed as a cure for
hemorrhage and fever. After it was brought to our shores its fame
increased rather than waned. During the reign of Charles the First it
was taken to Newcastle-on-Tyne to stay a pestilence raging there, a
bond for six thousand pounds being given as a guarantee of its safe
return. The amulet did its work so well, that to ensure its retention
in the town the bond would have been willingly forfeited. It was
reckoned of use in the treatment of almost any ailment, but specially
in cases of hydrophobia. A cure effected by it at the beginning of last
century is on record. Lady Baird of Saughton Hall, near Edinburgh,
showed what were believed to be symptoms of rabies from the bite of a
dog. At her request the Lee Penny was sent to Saughton Hall. She drank
and bathed in water in which it had been dipped, and restoration was
the result. The amulet was also used for the cure of cattle, and when
every other remedy failed recourse was had to the wonder-working gem.
When it was employed for therapeutic purposes, the following was the
<i lang="la">modus operandi</i>:&mdash;It was drawn once round the
vessel containing the water to be rendered medicinal, and was then
plunged thrice into the liquid; but no words of incantation were used.
For this reason the Reformed Church, when seeking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>to
abolish certain practices of heathen origin, sanctioned the continued
use of the Lee Penny as a charm. A complaint was made against the Laird
of Lee &ldquo;anent the superstitious using of ane stane set in silver
for the curing of diseased cattell.&rdquo; The complaint came before
the Assembly which met in Glasgow; but the case was dismissed on the
ground that the rite was performed &ldquo;wtout using onie words such
as charmers and sorcerers use in their unlawfull practices; and
considering that in nature there are mony things seen to work strange
effects, q.<sup>r.</sup> of no human wit can give a reason.&rdquo;
Nevertheless the Laird of Lee was admonished &ldquo;in the useing of
the said stane to tak heed that it be used hereafter w.<sup>t.</sup>
the least scandal that possiblie may be.&rdquo; Belief in the efficacy
of the amulet continued to hold its ground in the neighbourhood of Lee
till towards the middle of the present century. In 1839 phials of water
which had felt its magical touch were to be seen hanging up in byres to
protect the cattle from evil influences. Some fifteen years earlier a
Yorkshire farmer carried away water from Lee to cure some of his cattle
which had been bitten by a mad dog. Attached to the amulet is a small
silver chain which facilitated its use when its services were required.
The charm is kept in a gold box, presented by the Empress Maria
Theresa.</p>
<p>Another south-country amulet, not, however, so famous as the Lee
Penny, is the piece of silver, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>known as the Lockerbie Penny.
It was, and still is, we suppose, used to cure madness in cattle. In
his &ldquo;<i>Folklore of the Northern Counties</i>,&rdquo; Mr.
Henderson gives the following particulars about the
charm:&mdash;&ldquo;It is put in a cleft stick and a well is stirred
round with it, after which the water is bottled off and given to any
animal so affected. A few years ago, in a Northumbrian farm, a dog bit
an ass, and the ass bit a cow; the penny was sent for, and a deposit of
fifty pounds sterling actually left till it was restored. The dog was
shot, the cuddy died, but the cow was saved through the miraculous
virtue of the charm.&rdquo; After the death of the farmer who borrowed
the Penny, several bottles of water were found stowed away in a
cupboard labelled &ldquo;Lockerbie Water.&rdquo; Mr. Henderson also
mentions another Border amulet, known as the Black Penny, for long the
property of a family at Hume-byers. It is larger than an ordinary
penny, and is believed to be a Roman coin or medal. When brought into
use it should be dipped in a well, the water of which runs towards the
south. Mr. Henderson adds:&mdash;&ldquo;Popular belief still upholds
the virtue of this remedy; but, alas! it is lost to the world. A friend
of mine informs me that half a generation back the Hume-byers Penny was
borrowed by some persons residing in the neighbourhood of Morpeth and
never returned.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=

<p class="first">Nowadays people put Murray or Black, or some similar

pilgrimage. In this case the term is a synonym for sight-seeing,
usually accomplished under fairly comfortable conditions. In ancient
times pilgrimages were, as a rule, serious matters with a serious aim.

<p>The object of such journeys was to benefit either soul or body, or
both. The doing of penance, or the fulfilling of a vow, sent devotees
to certain sacred spots, sometimes in distant lands, sometimes within
our own four seas. Cuthbert&rsquo;s shrine at Durham, where the
saint&rsquo;s body was finally deposited in 1070, after its nearly two
hundred years&rsquo; wanderings, was a noted resort of pilgrims in the
middle ages, and many cures were wrought at it. Archbishop Eyre, on the
authority of Reginald of Durham, tells of a certain man of noble birth,
belonging to the south of England, who could not find relief for his
leprosy. He was told to light three candles, and to dedicate them
respectively to St. Edmund, St. Etheldrith, and St. Cuthbert, and to
visit the shrine of the saint whose candle first burned out. The
candles were lighted, and the omen indicated the last-mentioned saint.
Accordingly, he travelled to the north country, and, after various
religious exercises, drew near the shrine of Cuthbert, and was cured.
The shrine in question was known even as far off as Norway. On one
occasion, at least, viz., in 1172, its miraculous aid was sought by an
invalid from that country. A young man of Bergen, who was blind, deaf,
and dumb, had sought relief at Scandinavian shrines for six years, but
in vain. The bishop suggested that he should try the virtue of an
English shrine, and recommended that lots should be cast, to determine
whether it was to be that of St. Edmund, St. Thomas, or St.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>Cuthbert. The lot fell to St. Cuthbert. The
young man passed through Scotland to Durham, and returned home cured.
The miracle, doubtless, still further increased the sanctity of the
saint&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>The Cross of Crail, in Fife, had the power of working wonderful
cures; and many were the pilgrims who flocked to it. Aberdour, in the
same county, had more than a local fame. The name of The
Pilgrims&rsquo; Well there tells its own tale. This well is now filled
up, but for centuries it attracted crowds of pilgrims. In the fifteenth
century the spot was so popular that about 1475, at the suggestion of
Sir John Scott, vicar of Aberdour, the Earl of Morton granted a piece
of land for the erection of an hospital to accommodate the pilgrims.
This hospital was named after St. Martha. It is not certain to whom the
Pilgrims&rsquo; Well was dedicated; but Fillan was probably its patron,
as the Rev. Wm. Ross conjectures, in an article on the subject in the
third volume of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland</i>.&rdquo; The church of Aberdour was dedicated to the
saint in question; and the well was near the old churchyard.</p>
<p>Ninian&rsquo;s shrine at Whithorn was the scene of various miracles
during the middle ages. In 1425 James the First granted a safe-conduct
to all strangers, coming to Scotland to visit it; and James the Fourth
made a pilgrimage to it once a year, and sometimes oftener. &ldquo;It
is likely,&rdquo; remarks the Rev. Daniel Conway in an article on
consecrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>springs in the south-west of Scotland,
&ldquo;that the spots in Wigtownshire, where Holy Wells were, marked
the route pursued by pilgrims bent on doing homage to the relics of St.
Ninian at Whithorn.&rdquo; Whithorn was not the only shrine visited by
James the Fourth. He went repeatedly on pilgrimage to St. Andrews,
Dunfermline, and Tain, and left offerings at the shrines of their
respective saints. When on pilgrimage the king was usually accompanied
by a large retinue, including a company of minstrels. He liked to have
his dogs and hawks with him too, to have a little hunting by the
way.</p>
<p>St. Kentigern&rsquo;s Well, in the so-called crypt of Glasgow
Cathedral, has already been mentioned. In the immediate neighbourhood
is the spot believed to mark the last resting place of the saint. Till
the Reformation his shrine attracted crowds of pilgrims. On special
occasions his relics were displayed, including his bones, his hair
shirt, and his scourge, and a red liquor that flowed from his tomb.
These, along with other relics belonging to the cathedral, were taken
to France by Archbishop Beaton in 1560. In the ancient parish of
Dundurcus, Elginshire, not far from the river Spey, once stood the
Chapel of Grace, and close to it was a well of the same name. The place
was a favourite resort of pilgrims. Lady Aboyne went to it once a year,
a distance of over thirty miles, and walked the last two miles of the
way on her bare feet. In 1638 an attempt was made to put a stop to the
pilgrimages, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>by destroying what then remained of the chapel.
The attempt, however, seems to have been fruitless, for in 1775, Shaw,
the historian of Moray, mentions that to it &ldquo;multitudes from the
western isles do still resort, and nothing short of violence can
restrain their superstition.&rdquo; In 1435, when &AElig;neas Silvius
(afterwards Pope Pius the Second) was sailing from the low countries to
Scotland on a political mission, he was twice overtaken by a storm, and
was in such danger that he vowed to make a pilgrimage, should he escape
drowning. At length he reached the Haddingtonshire coast in safety,
and, to fulfil his vow, set off barefoot, over ice-covered ground, to
Whitekirk, ten miles away, where there were a chapel and well,
dedicated to the Virgin. The journey left its mark on the pilgrim, for
we are told that he had aches in his joints ever afterwards. St.
Adrian&rsquo;s Chapel, in the Isle of May, in the Firth of Forth, had a
great reputation before the Reformation. The island has still its
Pilgrims&rsquo; Haven, and its Pilgrims&rsquo; Well close by.</p>
<p>Arch&aelig;ology bears witness to the popularity of pilgrimages in
former times. Between Moxley Nunnery, in Yorkshire, and St.
John&rsquo;s Well, about a mile away, are the remains of a causeway,
laid down for the convenience of devotees. At Stenton, in
Haddingtonshire, near the road leading to Dunbar, is the well of the
Holy Rood, covered by a small circular building with a conical roof.
The well is now filled up. Its former importance is indicated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>by the fact that the pathway between it and the
old church, some two hundred yards off, had a stone pavement, implying
considerable traffic to and from the spring. In the quiet Banffshire
parish of Inveraven, is a spring, at Chapelton of Kilmaichlie, near the
site of an ancient chapel. The spring is now almost forgotten, but its
casing of stone shows that, at one time, it was an object of interest
in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The author of &ldquo;<i>Marmion</i>,&rdquo; when describing the
arrival, at Lindisfarne, of the bark containing St. Hilda&rsquo;s holy
maids from Whitby, has the following picturesque lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The tide did now its flood-mark gain,</p>
<p class="line">And girdled in the saint&rsquo;s domain:</p>
<p class="line">For, with the flow and ebb, its style</p>
<p class="line">Varies from continent to isle;</p>
<p class="line">Dry-shod, o&rsquo;er sands, twice every day,</p>
<p class="line">The pilgrims to the shrine find way;</p>
<p class="line">Twice, every day, the waves efface</p>
<p class="line">Of staves and sandalled feet the trace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Towards the end of the same poem, in connection with
the Lady Clare&rsquo;s quest of water for the dying Marmion, we find
the following reference:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Where shall she turn?&mdash;behold her mark</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=

<p>In England, during the middle ages, there were various attempts to
regulate the custom of making pilgrimages to wells. A canon of King
Edgar, of date 963, prohibited the superstitious resorting to
fountains, and in 1102, one of the canons of St. Anselm permitted only
such wells to be visited as were approved of by the bishop. In
Scotland, vigorous efforts were made, after the Reformation, to abolish
the practice. Both Church and State combined to bring about this
result. In an Act of Parliament, of date 1581, allusion is made to the
&ldquo;pervers inclination of mannis ingyne to superstitioun through
which the dregges of idolatrie yit remanis in divers pairtis of the
realme be useing of pilgrimage to sum chappellis, wellis, croces, and
sic other monumentis of idolatrie, as also be observing of the festual
dayis of the santes sumtyme namit their patronis in setting forth of
bain fyres, singing of caroles within and about kirkes at certane
seasones of the yeir.&rdquo; In 1629 the practice was sternly forbidden
by an edict from the Privy Council. In connection with this edict,
Dalyell remarks, &ldquo;It seems not to have been enough that
congregations were interdicted from the pulpit preceding the wonted
period of resort, or that individuals, humbled on their knees, in
public acknowledgment of their offence, were rebuked or fined for
disobedience. Now, it was declared that, for the purpose of restraining
the superstitious resort, &lsquo;in pilgrimages to chappellis and
wellis, which is so frequent and common in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>this
kingdome, to the great offence of God, scandall of the kirk, and
disgrace of his Majesteis government; that commissioners cause diligent
search at all such pairts and places where this idolatrous
superstitioun is used, and to take and apprehend all suche persons of
whatsomever rank and qualitie whom they sall deprehend going in
pilgrimage to chappellis and wellis, or whome they sall know
thameselffes to be guiltie of that cryme, and to commit thame to waird,
until measures should be adopted for their trial and
punishment.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Prior to the date of the above edict
the Privy Council had not been idle, crowds of people were in the habit
of making a pilgrimage on May Day to Christ&rsquo;s Well, in Menteith,
where they performed certain superstitious rites. Accordingly, in 1624,
a Commission was issued to a number of gentlemen belonging to the
district instructing them to station themselves beside the well, to
apprehend the pilgrims and to remove them to the Castle of Doune. Even
such measures did not cause the practice to cease.</p>
<p>In 1628 several persons were accused before the kirk-session of
Falkirk of going in pilgrimage to the well in question, and being found
guilty, were ordered to appear in church three appointed Sundays, clad
in the garb of penitents. The same year the following warning was
issued by the aforesaid kirk-session:&mdash;&ldquo;It is statute and
ordained that if any person or persons be found superstitiously and
idolatrously, after this, to have passed in pilgrimage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>to
Christ&rsquo;s Well, on the Sundays of May to seek their health, they
shall repent <i>in sacco</i> and linen three several Sabbaths, and pay
twenty lib. (Scots) <i>toties quoties</i> for ilk fault; and if they
cannot pay it the baillies shall be recommended to put them in ward,
and to be fed on bread and water for aught days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scottish ecclesiastical records, indeed, bear ample testimony to the
zeal displayed by the Church in putting a stop to such visits. In his
&ldquo;<i>Domestic Annals of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; Chambers gives the
following picture of what was done by the kirk-session of Perth. The
example shows the lines usually followed in connection with such
prosecutions:&mdash;&ldquo;At Huntingtower there was a well, the water
of which was believed to have sanative qualities when used under
certain circumstances. In May, 1618, two women of humble rank were
before the kirk-session of Perth, &lsquo;who, being asked if they were
at the well in the bank of Huntingtower the last Sabbath, if they drank
thereof, and what they left at it, answered, that they drank thereof,
and that each of them left a prin (pin) thereat, which was found to be
a point of idolatrie in putting the well in God&rsquo;s room.&rsquo;
They were each fined six shillings, and compelled to make public avowal
of their repentance.&rdquo; In the parish of Nigg, Kincardineshire, is
St. Fittack&rsquo;s or St. Fiacre&rsquo;s Well, situated close to the
sea. It is within easy reach of Aberdeen across the Dee. Many a visit
was paid to it by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272"
name="pb272">272</a>]</span>the inhabitants of that burgh, from motives
of superstition. The Aberdeen kirk-session, however, did its duty in
the matter, and repeatedly forbade such visits. In 1630, &ldquo;Margrat
Davidson, spous to Andro Adam, was adjudget in ane unlaw of fyve
poundis to be payed to the collector for directing hir nowriss with hir
bairne to Sanct Fiackres Well, and weshing the bairne tharin for
recovirie of hir health; and the said Margrat and hir nowriss were
ordainit to acknowledge thair offence before the Session for thair
fault, and for leaveing ane offering in the well.&rdquo; The saint, to
whom the well was dedicated, is believed to have migrated from Scotland
to France early in the seventh century, and to have been held in much
esteem there. From Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Lives of the
Saints</i>&rdquo; we get the curious information that &ldquo;the name
<i>fiacre</i> was first given to hackney coaches, because hired
carriages were first made use of for the convenience of pilgrims who
went from Paris to visit the shrine of this saint.&rdquo; A well at
Airth, in Stirlingshire, was for long a centre of attraction. What was
done there may be learned from some entries in the local kirk-session
records quoted in Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Every-Day
Book</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;Feb. 3, 1757. Session convenit. Compeared
Bessie Thomson, who declairit schoe went to the well at Airth, and that
schoe left money thairat and after the can was fillat with water, they
keepit it from touching the ground till they cam hom.&rdquo;
&ldquo;February 24th.&mdash;Compeired Robert Fuird, who declared he
went to the well of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273"
name="pb273">273</a>]</span>Airth and spoke nothing als he went, and
that Margrat Walker went with him, and schoe said ye belief about the
well, and left money and ane napkin at the well, and all was done at
her injunction.&rdquo; &ldquo;March 21.&mdash;Compeired Robert Ffuird
who declairit yat Margrat Walker went to ye well of Airth to fetch
water to Robert Cowie, and when schoe com thair schoe laid down money
in God&rsquo;s name, and ane napkin in Robert Cowie&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo; The session ordered the delinquents to be admonished.</p>
<p>Years went on, and modes of thought gradually changed. Church and
State alike began to respect the liberty of the subject. Though visits
continued to be paid to holy wells, they ceased to be reckoned as
offences. People might still resort to the spots, so familiar to their
ancestors, and so much revered by them; but they no longer found
themselves shut up in prison, or made to do penance before the whole
congregation. Old customs continued to hold sway, though less stress
was laid on the superstitions, lying behind them. Thus it came to pass,
that pilgrimages to holy wells became more and more an excuse for
mirthful meetings among friends. This was specially true of Craigie
Well, in the parish of Avoch, in the Black Isle of Cromarty. The time
for visiting the spring was early in the morning of the first Sunday in
May. The well was situated near Munlochy Bay, a few yards above
high-water-mark, and gets its name from the crags around. A
correspondent of Chambers&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Book of Days</i>&rdquo;
thus describes what he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>saw and heard:&mdash;&ldquo;I
arrived about an hour before sunrise, but long before, crowds of lads
and lasses from all quarters were fast pouring in. Some, indeed, were
there at daybreak who had journeyed more than seven miles. Before the
sun made his appearance, the whole scene looked more like a fair than
anything else. Acquaintances shook hands in true Highland style,
brother met brother, and sister met sister, while laughter and all
kinds of country news and gossip were so freely indulged in, that a
person could hardly hear what he himself said.&rdquo; Amid all the stir
and bustle the spring itself was not neglected, for everyone took care
to have a drink. Some used dishes, while others, on hands and knees,
sucked up the water with the mouth. These latter were now and again
ducked over head and ears by their acquaintances, who much enjoyed the
frolic. No one went away without leaving a thread, or patch of cloth on
a large briar bush near the spring. Besides St. Fittack&rsquo;s Well,
there is another in Nigg parish called Downy Well. It used to be
resorted to in May, by persons who drank the water, and then crossed by
a narrow neck of land, called The Brig of a&rsquo;e Hair, to Downy
Hill&mdash;a green headland in the sea&mdash;where they amused
themselves by carving their names in the turf.</p>
<p>Brand, in his &ldquo;<i>Popular Antiquities</i>,&rdquo; gives the
following particulars about a custom that still prevailed in
Cumberland, when he wrote about forty years ago:&mdash;&ldquo;In some
parts of the North of England it has been a custom from time immemorial
for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>lads and lasses of the neighbouring villages to
collect together at springs or rivers, on some Sunday in May, to drink
sugar and water, where the lasses gave the treat: this is called
&ldquo;Sugar and Water Sunday.&rdquo; They afterwards adjourn to the
public-house, and the lads return the compliment in cakes, ale, punch,
&amp;c. A vast concourse of both sexes assemble for the above purpose
at the Giant&rsquo;s Cave, near Eden Hall in Cumberland, on the third
Sunday in May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not know whether sacred dramas were ever performed beside
Scottish springs; but Stow informs us that the parish clerks of London
made an annual pilgrimage to Clark&rsquo;s Well, near the Metropolis,
&ldquo;to play some large history of Holy Scripture.&rdquo; He also
mentions that a Miracle Play, lasting eight days, was performed at
Skinner&rsquo;s Well in the time of Henry the Fourth. South of the
Tweed, springs were often the scenes of festivity. Thus, to take only
one example, we find that pilgrims to St. Margaret&rsquo;s Well, at
Wereham in Norfolk, were in the habit, in pre-Reformation days, of
regaling themselves with cakes and ale, and indulging in music and
dancing. What occurred in Ireland down to the beginning of the present
century may be gathered from a passage in Mason&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>Statistical Account of Ireland</i>&rdquo; reprinted in the
&ldquo;<i>Folklore Journal</i>&rdquo; for 1888. After referring to
religious assemblies at Holy Wells the writer remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;At
these places are always erected booths or tents as in Fairs for selling
whisky, beer, and ale, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>at which pipers and fiddlers do
not fail to attend, and the remainder of the day and night (after their
religious performances are over and the priest withdrawn) is spent in
singing, dancing, and drinking to excess&#8202;&hellip;. Such places
are frequently chosen for scenes of pitched battles, fought with
cudgels by parties not only of parishes but of counties, set in formal
array against each other to revenge some real or supposed
injury.&rdquo; In Roman Catholic districts of Ireland, what are called
<i>patrons</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, gatherings in honour of the patron saints
of the place, are still popular. From an article on &ldquo;<i>Connemara
Folklore</i>,&rdquo; by G. H. Kinahan, in the &ldquo;<i>Folklore
Journal</i>&rdquo; for 1884, we learn that a consecrated spring at
Cashla Bay has, beside it, a large conical mound of sea-shells. These
are the remains of the shell-fish forming the food of the pilgrims
during the continuance of the patron, and cooked by them on the top of
the mound. Last century, in Ireland, the custom of carrying the water
of famous wells to distant parts, and there selling it, was not
unknown. A correspondent of the &ldquo;<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>&rdquo; mentions that about 1750 this was done in
connection with a miraculous spring near Sligo; and that, some years
earlier, the water of Lough Finn was sold in the district, where he
lived, at sixpence, eightpence, and tenpence per quart, according to
the different success of sale the carriers had on the road. A thatched
cottage stood close to the site of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Well at
Restalrig, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>and was inhabited by a man who carried the water
of the spring to Leith for sale.</p>
<p>Mr. William Andrews, in his &ldquo;<i>Old Time
Punishments</i>,&rdquo; tells of booths having been set up beside a
Lincolnshire gibbet in 1814, to supply provisions for the crowds who
came to see a murderer hanging in chains there. Less gruesome were the
fairs at one time held in the neighbourhood of springs, though even
they had certain unpleasant concomitants, which led in the end to their
discontinuance. In the united parish of Dunkeld and Dowally is Sancta
Crux Well, at Crueshill. Till towards the middle of the present
century, it was such a popular resort, that tents were set up and
refreshments sold to the pilgrims. Alcohol was so freely partaken of
that drunken brawls often ensued, and right-minded people felt that the
gathering would be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
St. Fillan&rsquo;s Fair, at Struan, took place on the first Friday
after New Year&rsquo;s Day (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>). It
was held on a spot close to the church, and not far from St.
Fillan&rsquo;s Well. It is now discontinued, but its stance is still
known as Croft-an-taggart, <i>i.e</i>., The Priest&rsquo;s Croft. The
Well Market, now held at Tomintoul, in Kirkmichael parish, Banffshire,
but formerly beside Fergan Well, has already been referred to. Writing
in April, 1892, a correspondent, who has resided in the parish for
nearly half-a-century, mentions the following particulars concerning
the spring:&mdash;&ldquo;The healing virtue of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>water is still believed in, especially on the
first Sunday of May, when parties still gather and watch the arrival of
Sunday morning with special care, many of them remaining there the
whole night and part of the Sabbath. Whoever first washes in the water
or drinks of it is cured of any disease or sore with which they may be
troubled.&rdquo; Our correspondent adds:&mdash;&ldquo;The annual market
of the district was held at Fergan Well, and the foundations of the
tents or booths where goods were sold are still visible: and very
probably there was a kind of mountain dew partaken of stronger than the
water that now flows from Fergan Well.&rdquo; We shall have something
more to say about fairs in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Though modern enlightenment has not entirely abolished the practice
of resorting to consecrated springs, it has, as a rule, produced a
desire for secrecy on the part of the pilgrims. When <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3123" title="Source: superstitous">superstitious</span>
motives are absent, and springs are visited merely from curiosity or
love of frolic, there is no sense of shame, and hence no need for
concealment. But when the pilgrims regard the practice as a magical
rite, they usually prefer to keep the rest of the world in the dark as
to their doings. Sir Arthur Mitchell truly remarks in his
&ldquo;<i>Past in the Present</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is well enough
understood that the business is not a Christian one, and that the
engaging in it is not a thing which it would be easy to justify. There
is a consciousness that it has not been gone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>about as an empty, meaningless ceremony, but
that it has involved an acknowledgment of a supernatural power
controlling human affairs and influenced by certain rites and
offerings&mdash;a power different from that which is acknowledged by
Christians. Hence it happens that there is a difficulty in getting
people to confess to these visits, and, of course, a greater difficulty
still in getting them to speak, freely and frankly, about the feelings
and beliefs which led to them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his &ldquo;<i>Scottish Markets and Fairs</i>&rdquo;
Sir J. D. Marwick observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Simple home needs, such as
plain food and clothing, articles of husbandry, and other indispensable
appliances of life gave rise to markets held at frequent fixed times,
at suitable centres. But as society grew and artificial needs sprung
up, these could only be met by trade; and trade on anything beyond a
very limited scale was only then practicable at fairs. Wherever large
numbers of persons were drawn together, at fixed times, for purposes of
business or religion or pleasure, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>an inducement was offered to
the merchant or pedlar, as well as to the craftsman, to attend, and to
provide by the diversity and quality of his wares for the requirements
of the persons there congregated.&rdquo; In the last chapter allusion
was made to such gatherings in connection with springs. We shall now
look at the dates when they were held, in order to trace their
connection with nature-festivals. Fairs, as distinguished from markets,
were of comparatively rare occurrence at any given place. In the
majority of instances, they can be traced back to some gathering held
in connection with what were originally holy days, and afterwards
holidays. Such holy days commemorated a local saint, the fame of whose
sanctity was confined to more or less narrow limits, or one whom
Christendom at large delighted to honour; or, again, a leading event in
sacred or legendary history deemed worthy of a place in the
ecclesiastical year. A few dates when fairs are, or were held at
various Scottish centres may be selected from Sir J. Marwick&rsquo;s
list. At Abercorn they were held on Michaelmas and St. Serf&rsquo;s
Day; at Aberdeen, on Whitsunday, Holy Trinity, Michaelmas, and St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Day; at Charlestown of Aboyne, on Candlemas,
Michaelmas, and Hallowmas; at Annan, on Ascension-day and Michaelmas;
at Ayr, on Mid-summer and Michaelmas; at Biggar, on Candlemas and
Mid-summer; at Clackmannan, on St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day; at
Cromdale, on St. Luke&rsquo;s Day, St. Peter&rsquo;s Day, Michaelmas,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>and St. George&rsquo;s Day; at Culross, on St.
Serf&rsquo;s Day, Martinmas, and St. Matthew&rsquo;s Day; at
Dalmellington, on Fastern&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en and Hallow E&rsquo;en; at
Dalmeny, on St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s Day and St. Luke&rsquo;s Day;
at Doune, on Martinmas, Yule, Candlemas, Whitsunday, Lammas, and
Michaelmas; at Dumbarton, on Patrickmas, Mid-summer, and Lammas; at
Fraserburgh, on St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s Day and Michaelmas; at
Fyvie, on Fastern&rsquo;s Eve, St. Peter&rsquo;s Day, and St.
Magdalene&rsquo;s Day; at Hamilton, on St. Lawrence&rsquo;s Day and
Martinmas; at Inveraray, on Michaelmas and St. Brandane&rsquo;s Day; at
Stranraer, on St. Barnabas&rsquo; Day and Lammas. Among the fairs at
Auchinblae were Pasch Market in April, and one called May Day to be
held on the 22nd of that month. This series might be indefinitely
enlarged; but as it stands it shows that the leading nature-festivals,
such as Yule, Easter, Whitsuntide, Mid-summer, Michaelmas, and
Hallowmas have a prominent place among the dates selected. An
examination of Sir J. Marwick&rsquo;s list further shows that the dates
of fairs were often fixed, not with reference to any particular holy
day, but to some day of a particular month, such as the second Tuesday,
or the third Thursday. Many of these occur in May. In ancient
documents&mdash;in Acts of Parliaments, for instance&mdash;dates were
commonly fixed by a reference to holy days. In Presbyterian Scotland
such a method of marking time is not now in fashion, though some relics
of the practice survive. We are still familiar with Whitsunday
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>and Martinmas as term-days, but how few now ever
think of them as ecclesiastical festivals!</p>
<p>The meaning of customs associated with the various holy days has
come to be duly recognised by the student of ecclesiastical
antiquities. While the Christian year was being evolved in the course
of centuries, certain festivals were introduced, as one might say,
arbitrarily, <i>i.e.</i>, without being linked to any pre-Christian
usages. From the point of view of Church <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3157" title="Source: clebrations">celebrations</span>, they have
not the same significance as those others that received, as their
heritage, certain rights in vogue before the spread of Christianity. In
other words, the leading pagan festivals had a new meaning put into
them, and, when adopted by the Church, were exalted to a position of
honour. In virtue of this, the ecclesiastical year was correlated to
the natural year, with its varying seasons and its archaic festivals.
There is no doubt that in early times the Church sought to win nations
from paganism by admitting as many of the old customs as were deemed
harmless. We have seen how this was effected in the case of fountains,
as shown by Columba&rsquo;s exorcism of the demons inhabiting springs.
The same principle prevailed all round. The old Saturnalia of the
Romans, for instance, became the rejoicings of Christmas. To the
distinctively Christian aspects of the festival we do not, of course,
allude, but to the customs still in vogue at the Yule season; and these
are nothing more than a revised edition of the old pagan rites.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>Among other Aryan peoples the winter solstice
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3162" title="Source: was was">was</span>
also commemorated by similar merry-makings. Church festivals, such as
Candlemas, Easter, St. John&rsquo;s Day, St. Peter&rsquo;s Day,
Michaelmas, Hallowmas, Christmas, &amp;c., absorbed many distinctive
features of the old pagan fire-festivals, held in connection with the
changes of the seasons. The kindling of fires out of doors, on special
occasions, is familiar to all of us. They may be called modern
folk-customs; but their origin is ancient enough to give them special
significance. Even to the present time, twinkling spots of light may be
seen along the shores of Loch Tay on Hallow E&rsquo;en, though the
mid-summer fires do not now blaze on our Scottish hills, as they
continue to do in Scandinavia and elsewhere. Among the Bavarian
Highlands these mid-summer fires are popularly known as
<i>Sonnenwendfeuer</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, solstice-fires. That they are so
called and not St. John&rsquo;s fires (though lighted in connection
with his festival) is significant. In Brittany a belief prevailed that
if a girl danced nine times round one of the St. John&rsquo;s fires
before midnight she would be married within the year.</p>
<p>The most important fire-festival in Scotland was that of Beltane at
the beginning of May. It was celebrated generally throughout our land.
To the south of the Forth several sites are known to have been
specially associated with Beltane fires. In Lanarkshire two such sites
were, the hills of Tinto and Dechmont. Tinto, indeed, means the hill of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>fire. It was used for beacon-fires as well as
for those connected with nature-festivals, and was well adapted for the
purpose, being 2335 feet above the sea, and 1655 feet above the Clyde
at its base. Though not nearly so high, Dechmont hill commands a
splendid view over the neighbouring country. Early in the present
century a quantity of charcoal was discovered near its summit hidden
beneath a stratum of fine loam. The country people around expressed no
surprise at the discovery, as they were familiar with the tradition
that the spot had been used for the kindling of Beltane fires. In
Peeblesshire, too, the Beltane festival long held its ground. In the
fifteenth century the town of Peebles was the scene of joyous May Day
gatherings. From far and near, holiday-makers, dressed in their best,
came together to join in the Beltane amusements. Who has not heard of
the poem, &ldquo;<i>Peblis to the Play</i>,&rdquo; attributed to King
James the First? The play consisted of a round of rural
festivities&mdash;archery and horse-racing being the chief recreations.
Pennant gives a minute account of Beltane rites as practised about
1772. &ldquo;On the first of May the herdsmen of every village hold
their Bel-tein, a rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the
ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of
wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oat-meal, and
milk, and bring, besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer
and whisky; for each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286"
name="pb286">286</a>]</span>of the company must contribute something.
The rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground by way
of libation; on that, every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are
raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the
supposed preserver of their flocks and herds, or to some particular
animal, the real destroyer of them; each person then turns his face to
the fire, breaks off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says,
&lsquo;This I give to thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee,
preserve thou my sheep&rsquo;; and so on. After that they use the same
ceremony to the noxious animals, &lsquo;This I give to thee, O fox!
spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded crow! this to thee, O
eagle!&rsquo; When the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle; and
after the feast is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed
for that purpose; but on the next Sunday they reassemble and finish the
reliques of the first entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An examination of the dates when fire-festivals were held shows that
they had a distinct connection with the sun&rsquo;s annual cycle. When
several leading Church festivals fell to be observed about the same
time of the year, they had often some features in common. Thus the
pagan mid-summer festival had as its lineal successor, not only St.
John&rsquo;s Day (24th June), but St. Vitus&rsquo;s Day and St.
Peter&rsquo;s Day, respectively the fifteenth and the twenty-ninth of
the same month. The kindling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=
"#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>of fires was a feature of all
three. Medi&aelig;val fire-festivals were thus the gleanings of rites
derived from archaic sun-worship.</p>
<p>The question arises, what connection was there between the custom
and the cult? Mr. J. G. Frazer, in his &ldquo;<i>Golden
Bough</i>,&rdquo; has collected a variety of facts which go to show
that the lighting of these fires was primarily intended to ensure the
shining of the sun in the heavens. Mr. Frazer thus sums up the
evidence: &ldquo;The best general explanation of these European
fire-festivals seems to be the one given by Mannhardt, namely, that
they are sun-charms or magical ceremonies intended to ensure a proper
supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants. Savages resort to
charms for making sunshine, and we need not wonder that primitive man
in Europe has done the same. Indeed, considering the cold and cloudy
climate of Europe during a considerable part of the year, it is natural
that sun-charms should have played a much more prominent part among the
superstitious practices of European peoples than among those of savages
who live nearer the equator. This view of the festivals in question is
supported by various considerations drawn partly from the rites
themselves, partly from the influence which they are believed to exert
upon the weather and on vegetation.&rdquo; After alluding to certain
sun-charms, Mr. Frazer continues, &ldquo;In these the magic force is
supposed to take effect through mimicry <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>or sympathy; by
imitating the desired result you actually produce it; by counterfeiting
the sun&rsquo;s progress through the heavens you really help the
luminary to pursue his celestial journey with punctuality and
despatch&#8202;&hellip;. The influence which these bonfires are
supposed to exert on the weather and on vegetation goes to show that
they are sun-charms, since the effects ascribed to them are identical
with those of sunshine. Thus, in Sweden, the warmth or cold of the
coming season is inferred from the direction in which the flames of the
bonfire are blown; if they blow to the south it will be warm, if to the
north, cold. No doubt at present the direction of the flames is
regarded merely as an augury of the weather, not as a mode of
influencing it. But we may be pretty sure that this is one of the cases
in which magic has dwindled into divination.&rdquo; Hence a good supply
of light and heat is not only foretold, but guaranteed.</p>
<p>The view that these fires were reckoned mock-suns is confirmed by
the custom, at one time common, of carrying lighted brands round the
fields to ensure their fertility. Blazing torches were thus carried in
Pennant&rsquo;s time in the middle of June. Martin refers to the
carrying of fire in the Hebrides. &ldquo;There was an antient custom in
the Island of Lewis to make a fiery circle about the houses, corn,
cattle, &amp;c., belonging to each particular family. An instance of
this round was performed in the village Shadir, in Lewis, about sixteen
years ago <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>(<i>i.e.</i>, <i>circa</i> 1680), but it proved
fatal to the practiser, called MacCallum; for, after he had carefully
performed this round, that very night following he and his family were
sadly surprised, and all his houses, corn, cattle, &amp;c., were
consumed with fire. This superstitious custom is quite abolished now,
for there has not been above this one instance of it in forty years
past.&rdquo; Till a later date in Lewis, fire continued to be carried
round children before they were baptised, and round mothers before they
were churched, to prevent evil spirits from doing harm.</p>
<p>Burghead, in Elginshire, is still the scene of an annual
fire-festival, celebrated on the last day of the year (<abbr title=
"Old Style">O.S.</abbr>). It is locally known as <i>the burning of the
clavie</i>. On the afternoon of the day in question, careful
preparations are made for the ceremony. A tar barrel is sawn across,
and of it the clavie is made. A pole of firwood is stuck through the
barrel, and held in its place by a large nail driven in by a stone, no
hammer being used. The clavie is then filled with tar and pieces of
wood. After dark these combustibles are kindled, according to ancient
practice, by a burning peat from a neighbouring cottage. The clavie is
then lifted by one of the men and carried through the village amid the
applause of the inhabitants. Notwithstanding the risk from the burning
tar, the possession of the clavie, while on its pilgrimage, is eagerly
coveted. In former times, a stumble on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>part
of the bearer was counted unlucky for himself personally, and for the
village as a whole. After being borne about for some time, the still
blazing clavie is placed on an adjacent mound called the Doorie, where
a stone column was built some years ago for its accommodation. A hole
in the top of the column receives the pole. There the clavie is allowed
to burn for about half-an-hour, when it is thrown down the slope of the
mound. The burning fragments are eagerly snatched up and carried away
by the spectators. These fragments were formerly kept as charms to
ensure good fortune to their possessors. In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries the Church discountenanced the burning of the
clavie as idolatrous and sinful, and certain penalties were threatened
against all who took part in it. The antiquity of the custom may be
inferred from the fact, that two hundred years ago it was called old.
At that time lights were carried round the boats in the harbour, and
certain other ceremonies were performed, all pointing to a pagan
origin. Formerly the custom was in vogue, not only at Burghead, but at
most of the fishing villages along the Morayshire coast. The object in
every case was the same, viz., the blessing of the boats to ensure a
good fishing season.</p>
<p>A singular survival of sun-worship is to be found in the use of a
fiery circle as a curative agent. In the volume of the
&ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>&rdquo; for 1889&ndash;90, the Rev. Dr. Stewart
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>of Nether Lochaber recounts a recent instance of
its use in the Highlands. A dwining child, a year and a half old, was
pronounced by a &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; of the district to be
suffering from the effects of an &ldquo;evil eye.&rdquo; The rite,
called in Gaelic, <i>Beannachd-na-Cuairte</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;Blessing of the Circle,&rdquo; was accordingly resorted to. A
straw rope was wound round the greater part of an iron hoop, and, oil
being applied, the whole was set on fire. The hoop was then held
vertically, and through the blazing circle the child was passed and
repassed eighteen times to correspond to the months of its life. The
blazing hoop was then extinguished in a neighbouring burn. The result
was in every way to the satisfaction of the child&rsquo;s relatives. In
the same article Dr. Stewart gives an account, sent to him by a friend,
of a similar superstition common in Wigtownshire till about
half-a-century ago. In this case, the healing influence came through
the channel of the iron tire of a new cart wheel. After fire had been
applied to it to make it fit the wheel, the tire was passed over the
head of the patient, who was thus placed in the middle of a glowing
circle.</p>
<p>So much for the traces of sun-worship in rites connected with fire.
There are traces of it also in certain folk-customs, at one time
common, and not yet extinct. Highlanders were formerly in the habit of
taking off their bonnets to the rising sun. Akin to this is the feeling
underlying the Venetian expedition to the Lido, annually repeated in
July, when thousands cross to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292"
href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>that island at dawn, and
utter a loud shout when the sun rises above the horizon. In cases where
sun-worship is a national cult we naturally expect it to have a marked
influence on the sacred customs and architecture of its votaries. One
example will suffice. In his &ldquo;<i>Pre-historic Man</i>,&rdquo; Sir
Daniel Wilson thus describes the great annual festival of the
Peruvians, held at the summer solstice:&mdash;&ldquo;For three days
previous, a general fast prevailed; the fire on the great altar of the
sun went out, and in all the dwellings of the land no hearth was
kindled. As the dawn of the fourth day approached, the Inca, surrounded
by his nobles, who came from all parts of the country to join in the
solemn celebration, assembled in the great square of the capital to
greet the rising sun. The temple of the national deity presented its
eastern portal to the earliest rays, emblazoned with his golden image,
thickly set with precious stones, and as the first beams of the morning
were reflected back from this magnificent emblem of the god of day,
songs of triumph mingled with the jubilant shout of his worshippers.
Then, after various rites of adoration, preparations were made for
rekindling the sacred fire. The rays of the sun, collected into a focus
by a concave mirror of polished metal, were made to inflame a heap of
dried cotton; and a llama was sacrificed as a burnt offering to the
sun.&rdquo; Even after sun-worship has ceased to be a national cult, we
find it continuing to regulate the position of buildings, devoted to a
totally different worship. In this way what is commonly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>styled the &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; of
Christian churches can be accounted for. Indeed, so much had the sun to
do with churches, that when one was built in honour of a particular
saint, it was made to face the point of the horizon, where the sun rose
on the festival of the saint in question.</p>
<p>In our own land much stress used to be laid on the necessity of
turning according to the course of the sun, <i>i.e.</i>, from left to
right. To do so tended to bring prosperity to whatever was being
undertaken at the time. Martin often refers to such a turn under the
title of <i>Dessil</i>, a word of Gaelic origin, in connection with
which, it is interesting to note that in Gaelic <i>Deas</i> signifies
both south and to the right. Martin mentions certain stones, round
which the inhabitants of the Western Isles made what he calls &ldquo;a
religious turn.&rdquo; In the island of Eigg, he tells
us:&mdash;&ldquo;There is a heap of stones called <i>Martin Dessil</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, a place consecrated to the saint of that name, about which
the natives oblige themselves to make a tour round sunways.&rdquo; It
was also customary when anyone wished well to another to walk round him
thrice sunways. The following are some of Martin&rsquo;s own
experiences in the matter of the Dessil:&mdash;&ldquo;Some are very
careful, when they set out to sea, that the boat be first rowed about
sunways; and if this be neglected they are afraid their voyage may
prove unfortunate. I had this ceremony paid me (when in the island of
Ila) by a poor woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"
name="pb294">294</a>]</span>after I had given her an alms. I desired
her to let alone that compliment, for I did not care for it; but she
insisted to make these three ordinary turns, and pray&rsquo;d that God
and MacCharmaig, the patron saint of that island, might bless and
prosper me in all my designs and affairs. I attempted twice to go from
Ila to Collonsay, and at both times they row&rsquo;d about the boat
sunways, tho&rsquo; I forbid them to do it; and by a contrary wind the
boat and those in it were forced back. I took boat again a third time
from Jura to Collonsay, and at the same time forbid them to row about
their boat, which they obey&rsquo;d, and then we landed safely at
Collonsay without any ill adventure, which some of the crew did not
believe possible for want of the round.&rdquo; This superstition
lingered long after Martin&rsquo;s time, and probably still directs the
course of many a fishing-boat when being put to sea. In connection with
events of moment&mdash;such as baptisms, bridals, and burials&mdash;the
necessity for turning sunways was felt to be specially binding; but
even in matters of no particular importance the rule was held to apply.
If movement sunways was lucky, movement in a contrary direction was the
reverse. Such a movement was, and still is, known as <i>Widdershins</i>
or <i>Withershins</i>, the Shetland form being <i>Witherwise</i>. To go
Widdershins was to go against the sun, and was hence regarded as a
violation of the established order of things. In his &ldquo;<i>Darker
Superstitions</i>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>Dalyell remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;The
moving widderschynnes, as if withdrawing from the deified orb of day,
inferred a guilty retreat, and was associated with the premeditated
evil of sorcery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have thus glanced at the relations of springs to fairs, of fairs
to Church festivals, of Church festivals to nature festivals, and of
these to sun-worship. We shall now gather together the threads of the
argument, and indicate some of the chief points of connection between
well-worship and sun-worship. To do this, we must inquire when springs
were mainly visited. When a well was under the patronage of a saint,
the festival day of that saint was in some cases the day selected. It
would be natural to regard this as the rule. But, as a matter of fact,
pilgrimages were commonly made on days other than the festival of the
patron saint. As may be remembered, the Holy Pool in Strathfillan was
mainly resorted to on the first day of the quarter (<abbr title=
"Old Style">O.S.</abbr>); and St. Fillan&rsquo;s Spring at Comrie on
1st May and 1st August. As may be also remembered, the waters of Loch
Manaar, in Sutherland, were thought to possess special virtue on the
first Monday of February, May, August, and November (<abbr title=
"Old Style">O.S.</abbr>), the second and third of these dates being
specially popular. What the practice was at Mochrum Loch, in
Wigtownshire, is clear from Symson&rsquo;s account in his
&ldquo;<i>Description of Galloway</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;This loch,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is very famous in many writers, who report that it
never freezeth in the greatest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>frosts&#8202;&hellip;.
&ldquo;Whether it had any virtue of old I know not, but sure I am it
hath it not now. However, I deny not but the water thereof may be
medicinal, having received several credible informations that several
persons, both old and young, have been cured of continued diseases by
washing therein. Yet still I cannot approve of their washing three
times therein, which they say they must do, neither the frequenting
there of the first Sunday of February, May, August, and November,
although many foolish people affirm that, not only the water of this
loch, but also many other springs and wells, have more virtue on those
days than any other.&rdquo; Close to the Welltrees meadow in Sanquhar
parish, once flowed a spring dedicated to St. Bridget. In his history
of the parish, Mr. James Brown tells us that, according to the
testimony of the old people, it was customary for the maidens of
Sanquhar to resort on May Day to St. Bride&rsquo;s Well, where each
presented nine smooth white stones as an offering to the saint. Till
about the beginning of the present century, a well at Sigget, in
Aberdeenshire, was regularly visited on Pasch Sunday, and the usual
offerings were left by the pilgrims. There is, or was a belief at
Chapel-en-le-Frith, in Derbyshire, that on Easter Eve a mermaid appears
in a certain pool; and at Rostherne, in Cheshire, that another mermaid
comes out of the lake there on Easter Day and rings a bell. Mr. Moore
mentions that in the Isle of Man Ascension <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>Day
and the first Sunday of August were the principal days for visiting
consecrated springs. As previously stated, part of the May Day rites at
Tullie-Beltane, in Perthshire, consisted in drinking water from a
spring, and in walking nine times round it. St. Anthony&rsquo;s Well,
near Edinburgh, is not yet forgotten on May Day by people who like to
keep up old customs. There is no doubt that of all the months of the
year May was the one, when Scottish springs were most visited. The same
rule held elsewhere. In his &ldquo;<i>Romances of the West of
England</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Hunt has the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The
practice of bathing rickety children on the first three Wednesdays in
May is still far from uncommon in the outlying districts of Cornwall.
The parents will walk many miles for the purpose of dipping the little
sufferers in some well from which the healing virtue has not entirely
departed. Among these holy wells, Cubert is far famed. To this well the
peasantry still resort, firm in the faith that there, at this special
season, some mysterious virtue is communicated to its waters. On these
occasions, only a few years since, the crowd assembled was so large
that it assumed the character of a fair.&rdquo; A spring at
Glastonbury, in Somerset, on account of a miraculous cure, believed to
have been wrought by its water, became specially popular about the
middle of last century. In 1751, as many as ten thousand persons are
said to have visited it during the month of May. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>The popularity of May did not depend on the better weather following
the bleakness of winter and spring. At least, if it did so, it was only
in a subordinate degree. To find the main reason, we have to look to
the continued influence of ancient pagan rites. As we have seen, May in
Scotland was ushered in by the Beltane Festival. We have also seen that
its manifestly heathen customs survived till a late period in the midst
of a Christian civilisation. On the hypothesis of a pagan origin alone,
can certain May Day customs and beliefs be satisfactorily explained.
Some Beltane rites still survive in the Highlands, though fires are no
longer kindled. In the neighbourhood of Kingussie, Inverness-shire,
bannocks and hard-boiled eggs continue to be rolled down the hills on
the first of May (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>). Till quite
lately, these bannocks were used for purposes of divination. They were
marked on one side with a cross&mdash;the sign of life; and on the
other with a circle&mdash;the sign of death. Each bannock was rolled
down thrice, and its owner&rsquo;s fate was decided by the sign that
was on the upper surface oftenest when the bannock rested at the foot
of the hill. The time was counted specially suited for love-charms. On
May Day, in the north of England, a gold ring was dropped into a
syllabub composed of various ingredients. Whoever got hold of the ring
with a ladle would be the first among the company to be married. The
prophetic powers of May Day are still believed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>in,
in some parts of the north of Ireland. If a maiden places a certain
plant below her pillow overnight, she will have a vision of her coming
husband.</p>
<p>On May Day, the supernatural world was revealed, and witches and
other uncanny creatures were abroad. In connection with his visit to
Scotland, Pennant says:&mdash;&ldquo;In some parts of the country is a
rural sacrifice, different from that before mentioned. A cross is cut
on some sticks, which is dipped in pottage, and the Thursday before
Easter one of each placed over the sheep-cot, the stable, or the
cow-house. On the first of May they are carried to the hill, where the
rites are celebrated, all decked with wild flowers, and after the feast
is over, replaced over the spots they were taken from.&rdquo; The cross
in this case, was, doubtless, made from the wood of the rowan or
mountain ash. In the Isle of Man, it was customary, at one time, to
gather primroses on May Eve, and strew them before the door of every
house to keep away witches. Aubrey tells
us:&mdash;&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;Tis commonly said in Germany that the
witches do meet in the night before the first day of May upon an high
mountain called the Blocksberg, where they, together with the devils,
do dance and feast, and the common people do, the night before the said
day, fetch a certain thorn and stick it at their house door, believing
the witches can then do them no harm.&rdquo; In our own country, too,
hawthorn branches were formerly used on May Day as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>charm against witches. The hawthorn had likewise
another mystic property attributed to it. The dew on its branches on
the first of May had the power of giving beauty to the maiden who
washed her face with it. May-dew from the grass was equally
efficacious, except when gathered from within a fairy ring, as the
fairies would in that case counteract the influence of the charm. A
curative power was also ascribed to May-dew. Till quite lately there
was a belief in some parts of England that a weakly child would be made
strong by being drawn over dewy grass on the morning in question. To
effect a complete cure, the treatment had to be repeated on the two
following mornings. Dew from the grave of the last person buried in the
parish churchyard was counted specially remedial if applied to the
affected part before sunrise on May-morning.</p>
<p>The May-sun also got the credit of working cures. In his
&ldquo;<i>Nether Lochaber</i>&rdquo; the Rev. Dr. Stewart tells us that
&ldquo;it was an article of belief in the hygiene code of the old
highlanders that the invalid suffering under any form of internal
ailment, upon whom the sun of May once fairly shed its light, was
pretty sure of a renewed lease of life until at least the next autumnal
equinox.&rdquo; The old English custom, known as &ldquo;going
a-Maying,&rdquo; when old and young flocked into the woods early on
May-morning to gather flowers and green boughs, was handed on from a
time when the worship of trees was an article of religious faith.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another old custom in England, viz., the blowing of horns at an
early hour on the first of May, had probably its origin in
pre-Christian times. It still survives in Oxfordshire and Cornwall.
From Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Every-Day Book</i>&rdquo; we learn that
till the third decade of the present century, and doubtless later, the
poorer classes in Edinburgh poured forth at daybreak from street and
lane to assemble on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat to see the sun rise on
May-morning. Bagpipes and other musical instruments enlivened the
scene, nor were refreshments forgotten. About six o&rsquo;clock a crowd
of citizens of the wealthier class made their appearance, while the
majority of the first-comers returned to the town. At nine
o&rsquo;clock the hill was practically deserted. Two centuries earlier
an attempt was made by the kirk-session of Perth to put a stop to an
annual gathering on May Day at a cave in the face of Kinnoul hill
adjoining the town. This cave was called the Dragon Hole, and was the
scene of ancient rites of a superstitious nature. Other illustrations
might be selected from the Folklore of May Day, but those given above
show that the season was held in much superstitious regard.
Accordingly, we need not be surprised that well-worship took its place
among the rites of May Day, and of May Month also, since the whole of
May was deemed a charmed time.</p>
<p>The Sundays of May&mdash;particularly the first&mdash;were very
frequently chosen for visits to consecrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>springs. The Chapel Wells in Kirkmaiden parish
have already been referred to in connection with Co&rsquo; Sunday. The
White Loch of Merton, and St. Anthony&rsquo;s Spring at Maybole, and
others that might be named were principally resorted to on the first
Sunday of May. Indeed, wells occasionally got their name from the fact
of their being visited on Sundays. Thus Tobordmony, near Cushendall, in
County Antrim, signifies in Irish the Sunday Well. There is a farm in
Athole called Pit-alt-donich or Balandonich. The name is derived by Mr.
J. Mackintosh Gow from the Gaelic Pit-alt-didon-ich, and is interpreted
by him as meaning &ldquo;the hamlet of the Sunday burn.&rdquo; There is
a spring on the farm, formerly much frequented on the first Sunday of
May (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>). In the Isle of Man is a
spring called Chibber Lansh, consisting of three pools. In former times
it had a considerable reputation for the cure of sore eyes; but it was
thought to exert its power on Sundays alone. Pilgrims frequently spent
Saturday night beside springs in order to begin the required ritual on
the following morning. The question why Sunday was specially selected
is one of interest. Its choice may have been due in part to the fact,
mentioned by Dalyell, that, in ruder society, the precise course of
time requires some specific mark, and in part, to the notion underlying
the popular saying, &ldquo;the better the day, the better the
deed.&rdquo; But there was undoubtedly another factor in the selection
of the day. We have seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>that the chief Church festivals
borrowed certain rites from other festivals earlier in the field. In
like manner, Sunday was the heir of usages quite unconnected with it in
origin; or, to change the metaphor, it was a magnet attracting to
itself various stray particles of paganism that remained after the
break up of the old Nature-worship. Students of English history in the
seventeenth century cannot fail to remember, how strenuously the
Puritans sought to put down Sunday amusements, and how even the edicts
of James the First and Charles the First permitted only certain games
to be played on Sunday, certain others being declared inconsistent with
the aim of that Christian festival.</p>
<p>Bourne, in his &ldquo;<i>Popular Antiquities</i>,&rdquo; published
in 1725, remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;In the southern parts of this nation the
most of country villages are wont to observe some Sunday in a more
particular manner than the other common Sundays of the year, viz., the
Sunday after the Day of Dedication, <i>i.e.</i>, the Sunday after the
Day of the Saint to whom their church was dedicated. Then the
inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest clothes, and have open
doors and splendid entertainments for the reception and treating of
their relations and friends who visit them on that occasion from each
neighbouring town. The morning is spent for the most part at church,
the remaining part of the day in eating and drinking, and so is also a
day or two afterwards, together with all sorts of rural pastimes and
exercises, such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>as dancing on the green, wrestling,
cudgelling, &amp;c. Agreeable to this, we are told that formerly, on
the Sunday after the Enc&oelig;nia, or Feast of the Dedication of the
Church, it was usual for a great number of the inhabitants of the
village, both grown and young, to meet together at break of day, and to
cry, &lsquo;Holy Wakes, Holy Wakes,&rsquo; and after Matens go to
feasting and sporting, which they continued for two or three
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoting from the &ldquo;<i>Presbyterie Buik of Aberdein</i>, 19th
June, 1607, in <abbr title="manuscript">M.S.</abbr>&rdquo; Dalyell
observes:&mdash;&ldquo;In the North of Scotland, young men conducted
themselves &lsquo;pro phanelie on the Sabboathes in drinking, playing
at futteball, dancing, and passing fra paroche to paroche&mdash;and sum
passes to St. Phitallis Well to the offence of God and ewill of
mony.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; In connection with this, a remark from Dr.
J. A. Hessey&rsquo;s Bampton Lecture on Sunday may be quoted. When
comparing it with the Holy days instituted in medi&aelig;val times, he
says, the former perhaps &ldquo;was even worse observed than the other
days, for in spite of the Church, men had a vague impression that it
was one of specially allowed intermission of ordinary employments. This
they interpreted to mean of more special permission of dissipation than
the other days noted in the kalendar.&rdquo; After describing the
island of Valay, near North Uist, where there were Chapels to St. Ulton
and St. Mary, Martin says, &ldquo;Below the Chapel there is a flat thin
stone call&rsquo;d Brownie&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305"
href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>Stone upon which the antient
inhabitants offer&rsquo;d a cow&rsquo;s milk every Sunday.&rdquo; That
this offering of milk, though made on Sundays, was a pagan and not a
Christian rite, can hardly be disputed. At some places, <i>e.g.</i>, at
Glasgow, Crail, and Seton, Sunday was at one time the weekly market
day, but by an Act of James the Sixth, in 1579, the holding of markets
on Sunday was prohibited throughout the realm. The Sundays in May were
certainly the most popular for visits to springs, but these occurring
about the time of the other leading nature-festivals were also in
fashion. Sun-worship, as we have seen, was the back-ground of all such
festivals. We need not wonder, therefore, that consecrated springs were
frequented on a day whose very name suggested a reminiscence of a solar
pagan cult.</p>
<p>We have discussed Beltane, let us now look at one other leading
nature-festival, viz., Lammas, on the first day of August, to discover
what light it throws on our subject. The Church dedicated the opening
day of August to St. Peter ad Vincula. A curious medi&aelig;val legend
arose to connect this dedication with another name for the festival,
viz., the <i>Gule of August</i>. At the heart of this legend was the
Latin word <i>Gula</i>, signifying the throat. The daughter of
Quirinus, a Roman tribune, had some disease of the throat which was
miraculously cured through kissing St. Peter&rsquo;s chains, and so the
day of the chains was designated the <i>Gule of August</i>. As a matter
of fact, the word is derived from the Cymric Gwyl, a feast or holiday,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>and we have confirmation of the etymology in the
circumstance, that in Celtic lands the time was devoted to games, and
other recreations. In Ireland a celebrated fair, called Lugnasadh, was
held at Tailtin (now Teltown), in Meath, for several days before and
after the first of August, and there was another at Cruachan, now Rath
Croghan, in Roscommon. A third was held at Carman, now Wexford. Its
celebration was deemed so important that, as Professor Rhys tells us,
in his &ldquo;<i>Celtic Heathendom</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;among the
blessings promised to the men of Leinster from holding it were, plenty
of corn, fruit, and milk, abundance of fish in their lakes and rivers,
domestic prosperity, and immunity from the yoke of any other province.
On the other hand, the evils to follow from the neglect of this
institution were to be failure and early greyness on them and their
kings.&rdquo; In legendary accounts of Carman, the place has certain
funereal associations. &ldquo;If we go into the story of the fair of
Carman,&rdquo; Professor Rhys observes, &ldquo;we are left in no doubt
as to the character of the mythic beings whose power had been brought
to an end at the time dedicated to that fair; they may be said to have
represented the blighting chills and fogs that assert their baneful
influence on the farmer&rsquo;s crops. To overcome these and other
hurtful forces of the same kind, the prolonged presence of the sun-god
was essential, in order to bring the corn to maturity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the Gule of August was a Nature-festival may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>be
further inferred from the fact that among many Anglo-Saxon peoples it
was called <i>Hl&acirc;f-m&aelig;sse</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, Loaf-mass,
eventually shortened into Lammas. Our English ancestors offered on that
day bread made from the early grain, as the first-fruits of the
harvest. In Scotland, the Lammas rites were handed down from an unknown
past and survived till the middle of last century. They were closely
connected with country life, and were taken part in, mainly by those
who had to do with the tending of cattle. The herds of Mid-Lothian held
Lammas in special favour. For some weeks prior to that date they busied
themselves in building what were called Lammas towers, composed of
stones and sods. These towers were about seven or eight feet high,
sometimes more. On the day of the festival they were surmounted by a
flag formed of a table-napkin decked with ribbons. During the building
of the towers attempts were sometimes made by rival parties to throw
them down, and accordingly they had to be kept constantly watched. On
Lenie hill and Clermiston hill two such towers used to be built, about
two miles apart, but within sight of each other. These were the
respective trysting-places of herds belonging to different portions of
Cramond and Corstorphine parishes. On Lammas morning the herds met at
their respective towers, and, after a breakfast of bread and cheese,
marched to meet each other, blowing horns, and having a piper at their
head. Colours were carried aloft by each party, and the demand to lower
them was the signal for a contest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308"
href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>which sometimes ended in
rather a curious manner. Games for small prizes closed the day&rsquo;s
proceedings.</p>
<p>At one time temporary structures formed of sods and sticks, and
known as Lammas houses, were built in South Wales in connection with
the festival. Inside these a fire was kindled for the roasting of
apples. Anyone, by paying a penny, could enter and have an apple.
Professor Rhys speaks of other Lammas rites in the Principality.
&ldquo;Gwyl Awst,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;is now a day for fairs in
certain parts of Wales, and it is remembered, in central and southern
Cardiganshire, as one on which the shepherds used, till comparatively
lately, to have a sort of pic-nic on the hills. One farmer&rsquo;s wife
would lend a big kettle for making in it a plentiful supply of good
soup or broth, while, according to another account, everybody present
had to put his share of fuel on the fire with his own hands. But, in
Brecknockshire, the first of August seems to have given way sometime
before Catholicism had lost its sway in Wales, to the first holiday or
feast in August; that is to say, the first Sunday in that month. For
then crowds of people, early in the morning, make their way up the
mountains called the Beacons, both from the side of Caermarthenshire
and Glamorgan; their destination used to be the neighbourhood of the
Little Van Lake, out of whose waters they expected, in the course of
the day, to see the Lady of the Lake make her momentary
appearance.&rdquo; Professor Rhys bears further witness to the
connection of Lammas rites with our <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>present subject when
he says, &ldquo;A similar shifting from the first of August to the
first Sunday in that month, has, I imagine, taken place in the Isle of
Man. For, though the solstice used to be, in consequence probably of
Scandinavian influence, the day of institutional significance in the
Manx summer, inquiries I have made in different parts of the island, go
to show that middle-aged people, now living, remember that, when they
were children, their parents used to ascend the mountains very early on
the first Sunday in August (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>), and
that in some districts at least they were wont to bring home bottles
full of water from wells noted for their healing virtues.&rdquo;
Another proof that the ceremonies of Lammas-tide had some link with
those of archaic Water-worship is to be found in the circumstance
mentioned by Dalyell, that, &ldquo;in Ireland the inhabitants held it
an inviolable custom to drive their cattle into some pool or river on
the first Sunday of August as essential to the life of the animals
during the year.&rdquo; This was regularly done till towards the end of
the seventeenth century. It may be remembered that in Scotland, during
the same century, horses were washed in the sea at Lammas, doubtless
with the same end in view.</p>
<p>We shall now glance at some traces of Sun-worship in the rites of
Well-worship. In countries where the worship of the sun had an
acknowledged place in the popular religion, the temples to that
luminary were found associated with fountains. In his &ldquo;<i>Holy
Land and the Bible</i>,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cunningham Geikie
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>remarks, &ldquo;The old name of Bethshemish,
which means the house of the sun, is now changed to Ain
Thenis&mdash;the fountain of the sun&mdash;living water being found in
the valley below. Both point to the Philistine Sun-worship, and both
names are fitting, for every sun-house or temple needed, like all other
ancient sanctuaries, a fountain near it to supply water for ablutions
and libations.&rdquo; When evidence of this kind fails us, we have
another kind within reach, viz., that derived from the employment of
fire to symbolise the sun on the principle already explained. At St.
Bede&rsquo;s Well, near Jarrow, in Durham, it used to be customary to
kindle a bonfire on Mid-summer Eve. In connection with the same
festival a bonfire was lighted at Toddel-Well, near Kirkhampton in
Cumberland, and the lads and lasses, who were present, were in the
habit of leaping through the flames. In a cave at Wemyss, in Fife, is a
well, to which young people at one time carried blazing torches on the
first Monday of January (<abbr title="Old Style">O.S.</abbr>). The time
of day when consecrated springs were made use of has a bearing on the
point under review. The water was thought to have a peculiar efficacy
either just after sunset or just before sunrise. The moment when the
sun was first seen above the horizon was also reckoned particularly
favourable. To the same class of superstitions belongs the Scandinavian
belief, referred to by Mr. Lloyd in his &ldquo;<i>Peasant Life in
Sweden</i>,&rdquo; that the water of certain sacred springs, known as
Fonts of the Cross, was turned into wine at sunrise. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>The survival of rites of archaic Sun-worship in the practice of
making a turn sun-ways has been already referred to.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we shall glance at the bearings of the practice on
the question of Well-worship. To make a visit to a spring effectual,
when a cure was wanted, the invalid had to pace round it from left to
right, in recognition of the fact that the sun moved in the same
direction. The sun, being the source of vitality, why should not an
imitation of its daily motion tend to produce the same result? When
speaking of Loch Siant Well, in Skye, Martin says:&mdash;&ldquo;Several
of the common people oblige themselves by a vow to come to this well,
and make the ordinary tour about it call&rsquo;d Dessil. They move
thrice round the well, proceeding sunways from east to west, and so on.
This is done after drinking of the water. Sometimes it was done
elsewhere before drinking of the water.&rdquo; The importance of this
motion comes clearly into view in the case of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Well,
at Shadar, in Lewis, referred to in a previous chapter. When the wooden
dish, floating on the surface of the water, turned round sun-ways, the
omen was a sign that the patient concerned would recover, but a turning
in the opposite direction foreboded ill.&rdquo; In reference to Chapel
Uny Well, in Cornwall, Mr. Hunt says:&mdash;&ldquo;On the first three
Wednesdays in May, children suffering from mesenteric diseases are
dipped three times in this well, against the sun, and dragged three
times around the well on the grass in the same direction.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>Mr. Lloyd tells us that, in Sweden, a remedy for
whooping-cough is to drink water, &ldquo;that drops from a mill-wheel,
which revolves <i>ansols</i>, that is, in a contrary direction to the
course of the sun.&rdquo; These two examples, however, are exceptions
to the rule. They may, perhaps, be explained on the principle that what
is in itself evil, because contrary to nature, brings good when
converted into a charm. To walk round a well <i>widdershins</i> was to
commit an act of sorcery. Mr. J. G. Barbour, in his &ldquo;<i>Unique
Traditions of the West and South of Scotland</i>,&rdquo; recounts the
trial and fate of a lonely old woman, who lived in the
Kirkcudbrightshire parish of Irongray, early in the seventeenth
century. She was accused of witchcraft, and, when convicted of the
crime, met her death by being rolled down hill inside a blazing tar
barrel. Various were the charges brought against her, one of them being
that, at certain hours she walked round the spring near her cottage
wuddershins. Mr. Barbour adds, &ldquo;The well, from which she drew the
water for her domestic use, and where the young rustic belles washed
their faces, still retains the name of the Witch&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo;
Faith in the benefit of turning sun-ways and faith in the efficacy of
south-running water belong to the same class of superstitions. Both
have a direct reference to the sun&rsquo;s course. The water of a
stream flowing to meet the sun, when its mid-day beams are casting
their sweet influences upon the earth, must absorb and retain a power
to bless and heal. So, at least, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>men thought, nor were they
slow to take advantage of the virtue that mingled with the water.
Bodily ailments were cured by washing in it, and it was used as one of
the many remedies to remove the evil effects of witchcraft. In this, as
in the other rites previously alluded to, we see the influence of a
cult that did not pass away, when the sun ceased to be worshipped as a
divinity. In other words, Well-worship cannot be adequately understood
if we leave out of account archaic Sun-worship, and its modern
survivals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To bring about the accomplishment of a cherished
desire by means of certain rites has been a favourite mode of
divination. By this method it was thought that destiny could be
coerced, and the wish made the father of its own fulfilment. The means
were various; but, underlying them all, was the notion that the doing
of something, in the present, guaranteed the happening of something in
the future. A mere wish was not sufficient. A particular spot, hallowed
by old associations, had to be visited, and a time-honoured ceremony
observed. But the ritual might be of the simplest. It was perchance to
some rustic gate that the village maiden stole in the gathering
gloaming, and there, with beating heart, breathed the wish that was to
bring a new happiness into her life. Love charms, indeed, form an
important <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>group of wishing superstitions. To this class
belong Hallow E&rsquo;en rites, such as eating an apple before a
mirror, and sowing hemp seed. These rites gave the maiden a vision of
her destined husband. In the one case, she saw his face in the glass,
and in the other, she saw him in the attitude of pulling hemp. The
dumb-cake divination, on the Eves of St. Mark and St. John, also
belongs to the same class of charms. Not more than three must take part
in the mystical ceremony. Concerning the cake, an English rule
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Two make it,</p>
<p class="line">Two bake it,</p>
<p class="line">Two break it,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and the third must put it under each of their pillows,
but not a word must be spoken all the time.&rdquo; Fasting on St.
Agnes&rsquo;s Eve was requisite on the part of any maiden, who sought
on that festival to have a vision of her bridegroom to be. According to
an old Galloway custom, a maiden pulled a handful of grass when she
first saw the new moon. While she pulled she repeated the
rhyme&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;New moon, new moon, tell me if you can,</p>
<p class="line">Gif I have a hair like the hair o&rsquo; my
gudeman.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The grass was then taken into the house, and carefully
examined. If a hair was found amongst the grass, it would correspond in
colour with the hair of the coming husband. In connection with all such
charms, it is certainly true what an old song says that &ldquo;love
hath eyes.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her Majesty the Queen visited Innis Maree in September, 1877. When
describing her visit, Mr. Dixon, in his &ldquo;<i>Gairloch</i>,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;She fixed her offering in the wishing tree, a
pleasantry which most visitors to the island repeat, it being common
report that a wish silently formed, when any metal article is attached
to the tree, will certainly be realised. It is said that if anyone
removes any offering that has been fixed on the tree, some misfortune,
probably the taking fire of the house of the desecrator, is sure to
follow.&rdquo; On a hill near Abbotsbury, in Dorset, stands St.
Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel. In its south doorway are wishing holes. The
knee is placed in one of the holes, and the hands in the two above; and
in this posture the visitor performs the wishing ceremony. Half-way
down the cliff near Stackpole Head, in Pembrokeshire, is an ancient
structure of rude masonry styled St. Govan&rsquo;s Chapel, at one time
the retreat of some recluse. Professor Cosmo Innes, in the third volume
of the &ldquo;<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland</i>,&rdquo; gives an account of a visit to the spot, and
adds:&mdash;&ldquo;The curious part of St. Govan&rsquo;s abode is his
bed, or rather his coffin, for it is a vertical interstice between two
immense slabs of rock, into which a body of common size can be forced
with some difficulty, the prisoner remaining upright. The rock is
polished by the number of visitors fitting themselves into the
saint&rsquo;s bed of penance, and the natives make you feel in the
inner surface the indentures caused by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>the ribs of the
saint!&rdquo; The polishing is mainly due to the fact that the space
has for long been used for wishing purposes. Those who desire to test
the efficacy of the spell must turn themselves round within the hollow
and think of nothing else during the process, except what they are
wishing for&mdash;a rather difficult test under the circumstances!
Close to the chapel is St. Govan&rsquo;s Well, under a covering of
stone-work. The spring had formerly a great reputation as a health
resort. Beside the remains of the once splendid monastic buildings at
Walsingham, in Norfolk, are wishing wells consisting of two small
circular basins of stone. In pre-Reformation times they were much
resorted to for the cure of disease. Being close to St. Mary&rsquo;s
Chapel, they were appropriately dedicated to the Virgin, to whom the
gift of healing was ascribed. Since then they have been popular as
wishing wells. The necessary ritual is thus described by Brand in his
&ldquo;<i>Popular Antiquities</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;The votary, with
a due qualification of faith and pious awe, must apply the right knee,
bare, to a stone placed for that purpose between the wells. He must
then plunge to the wrist each hand, bare also, into the water of the
wells which are near enough to admit of this immersion. A wish must
then be formed, but not uttered with the lips, either at the time or
afterwards, even in confidential communication to the dearest friend.
The hands are then to be withdrawn, and as much of the water as can be
contained in the hollow of each is to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>swallowed. Formerly
the object of desire was most probably expressed in a prayer to the
Virgin. It is now only a silent wish, which will certainly be
accomplished within twelve months, if the efficacy of the solemn rite
be not frustrated by the incredulity or some other fault of the
votary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pennant tells of a cistern connected with St. John&rsquo;s Well,
near Moxley Nunnery, at one time much used for bathing. Near these, and
below the surface of the water, was a piece of rock called the Wishing
Stone. Anyone who kissed this stone with firm belief in the efficacy of
the charm would have his desire granted. In this case the power of
securing the fulfilment of wishes went hand in hand with the power of
curing diseases. Generally speaking, however, as in the case of
Walsingham just mentioned, the former power supersedes the latter. In
other words, <i>healing</i> wells are transformed into <i>wishing</i>
wells. When such is the case, they are, as far as folklore <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3465" title="Source: in">is</span> concerned, in the
last stage of their history. In the wood, clothing the steep hill of
Weem, in Perthshire, is St. David&rsquo;s Well, said to be named after
a former laird who turned hermit. The spring has a considerable local
fame, and many have been the wishes silently breathed over its water.
Part of an ancient stone cross lies at its margin, and on it the
visitor kneels while framing his or her wish. Visitors to wishing wells
commonly drop into the water a coin, pin, or pebble, thus keeping up,
usually without being aware of the fact, the custom of offering a gift
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>the <i lang="la">genius loci</i>. The Rev. Dr.
Gregor thus describes what was dropped into the Bride&rsquo;s Well, in
the neighbourhood of Corgarff, Aberdeenshire:&mdash;&ldquo;This well
was at one time the favourite resort of all brides for miles around. On
the evening before the marriage, the bride, accompanied by her maidens,
went &lsquo;atween the sun an&rsquo; the sky&rsquo; to it. The maidens
bathed her feet and the upper part of her body with water drawn from
it. This bathing ensured a family. The bride put into the well a few
crumbs of bread and cheese, to keep her children from ever being in
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desires of any kind may be cherished at wishing-wells, but there is
no doubt that matters matrimonial usually give direction to the
thoughts. According to a Yorkshire belief, whoever drops five white
pebbles into the Ouse, near the county town, when the minster clock
strikes one on May morning, will see on the surface of the water
whatever he or she wishes. Near Dale Abbey, in Derbyshire, is a certain
holy well. To get full advantage of its help, one has to go between the
hours of twelve and three on Good Friday, drink the water thrice, and
wish. There is no doubt about the meaning of the following lines from
the Bard of Dimbovitza, a collection of Roumanian
Folk-Songs:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;There, where on Sundays I go alone,</p>
<p class="line">To the old, old well with the milk-white stone,</p>
<p class="line">Where by the fence, in a nook forgot,</p>
<p class="line">Rises a Spring in the daisied grass,</p>
<p class="line">That makes whoso drinks of it love&mdash;alas!</p>
<p class="line">My heart&rsquo;s best belov&egrave;d, he drinks it
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Pirate</i>&rdquo; one of the
characters expresses the wish that providence would soon send a wreck
to gladden the hearts of the Shetlanders. At the other extremity of
Britain, viz., in the Scilly Isles, the same hope was at one time
cherished. St. Warna, who had to do with wrecks, was the patron saint
of St. Agnes, one of the islands of the group. She had her holy well,
and there the natives anciently dropped in a crooked pin and invoked
the saint to send them a rich wreck.</p>
<p>It would be useless to attempt to give a list of Scottish
wishing-wells; but the following may be mentioned. There is one in West
Kilbride parish, Ayrshire, close to a cave at Hunterston. There is
another at Ardmore, in Dumbartonshire. At Rait, in Perthshire, is St.
Peter&rsquo;s Wishing-well. In the united parishes of Kilcalmonell and
Kilberry, in Argyllshire, is the ancient ecclesiastical site of
Kilanaish. &ldquo;Near the burial-ground,&rdquo; Captain White tells
us, &ldquo;is its holy well, where it is proper to wish the usual three
wishes, which, on my last visit to the place, our party, including one
lady, devoutly did.&rdquo; The same writer gives the following
particulars about another Argyllshire spring:&mdash;&ldquo;Near the
Abbey of Saddell, Kintyre, is a fine spring of the class known
throughout Scotland as Wishing-wells, which has always borne the name
of Holy-well. It had the usual virtues and wishing powers ascribed to
it. A pretty little pillar with cross cut upon it which has been
mistaken for one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"
name="pb321">321</a>]</span>of ancient date is scooped out into a small
basin to catch the drip of the water. It was erected by a Bishop Brown,
when residing at Saddell, in the beginning of the present century, to
replace another one that had formerly stood there. Beside it, flows a
stream called Alt-nam-Manach (the Monk&rsquo;s Burn), and this, with
the spring, no doubt formed the water supply of the
monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Anthony&rsquo;s Well, beside St. Anthony&rsquo;s ruined Chapel,
near Edinburgh, is probably the best known of Scottish wishing-wells.
Its sanative virtues have already been alluded to, but it is nowadays
more noted for its power of securing the fulfilment of wishes than the
recovery of health. A pleasant picture of the romantic spot is given by
Sir Daniel Wilson in his &ldquo;<i>Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden
Time</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;The ancient Hermitage and Chapel of St.
Anthony, underneath the overhanging crags of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, are
believed to have formed a dependency of the preceptory at Leith, and to
have been placed there, to catch the seaman&rsquo;s eye as he entered
the Firth, or departed on some long and perilous voyage; when his vows
and offerings would be most freely made to the patron saint, and the
hermit who ministered at his altar. No record, however, now remains to
add to the tradition of its dedication to St. Anthony; but the silver
stream, celebrated in the plaintive old song, &lsquo;O waly, waly up
yon bank,&rsquo; still wells clearly forth at the foot of the rock,
filling the little basin of St. Anthony&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>Well, and rippling pleasantly through the long
grass into the lower valley.&rdquo; The song in question gives
expression to the grief of Lady Barbara Erskine, wife of James, Marquis
of Douglas, in the time of Charles II., in connection with her
desertion by her husband&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Fortunately, the associations of St. Anthony&rsquo;s
Well have not all been so sad as the above. Many a hopeful moment has
been passed beside its margin. A little girl from Aberdeenshire, when
on a visit to friends in Edinburgh, made trial of the sacred spring.
She was cautioned not to tell anyone what her wish was, else the charm
would have no effect. On her return home, however, her eagerness to
know whether the wish had, in the meantime, been fulfilled, quite
overcame her ability to keep the secret. Her first words were,
&ldquo;Has the pony come?&rdquo; St. Anthony must have been in good
humour with the child, for he provided the pony, thus evidently
condoning the breach of silence in deference to her youth. Surely there
must be something in wishing-wells, after all, besides water.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mr. J. M. Barrie is a true interpreter of the youthful
mind when he says, in the &ldquo;<i>Little Minister</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Children like to peer into wells to see what the world is like
at the other side.&rdquo; Grown-up people are also alive to the mystery
of a spring. &ldquo;Look into its depth,&rdquo; observes Mr. E. H.
Barker in his &ldquo;<i>Wayfaring in France</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;until
the eye, getting reconciled to the darkness, catches the gleam of the
still water far below the ferns that hang from the gaping places in the
mossy wall, and you will find yourself spellbound by the great
enchantress, Nature, while understanding nothing of the mysterious
influence.&rdquo; In days of less enlightenment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>&ldquo;the weight of all this unintelligible
world&rdquo; was even more felt than now, and the minds of men were
ever on the outlook for the marvellous. What is to us a source of not
unpleasing mystery was then a cause of dread. We marvel and make
poetry. Our far-off ancestors trembled and sought refuge in magical
rites. We still speak of the charms of nature, but the phrase has to us
an altered meaning. When we remember how little science there was at
one time, we need not be surprised that the phenomena of the outer
world were misinterpreted, and hence gave rise to fallacies. This was
markedly so in the case of springs. While quenching thirst&mdash;a
natural function to perform&mdash;they became endowed with virtues of
an exceptional character, and were esteemed as the givers of health.
Even amid the darkness of those distant days we can detect a glimmering
of light, for such ideas were not wholly false. Erroneous ideas seldom
are. Springs have indeed a health-giving power. Whether or not we
accept the full-blown doctrines of modern hydropathy, we must allow
that cold water is an excellent tonic. As an acute writer has remarked,
&ldquo;Cold braces the nerves and muscles, and, by strengthening the
glands, promotes secretion and circulation, the two grand ministers of
health.&rdquo; Allusion has been made to the mineral waters of
Peterhead. The secret of their power is well described by Cordiner in
his &ldquo;<i>Antiquities and Scenery of the North of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>Scotland</i>,&rdquo; where he
says:&mdash;&ldquo;A mineral well in the summer months gives great
gaiety to the place; its salutary virtues have been long, I believe,
justly celebrated. The salt-water baths adjoining are much frequented
in nervous disorders: their effect in strengthening the constitution is
often surprising. Owing to the open peninsulated situation, the air of
this place is esteemed peculiarly pure and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3630" title="Source: heathful">healthful</span>; even the fogs
rising from the sea are thought to be medicinal; the town is therefore
much enlivened by the concourse of company who frequent it on these
accounts. Without derogating anything from the merits of the baths and
mineral, one may reasonably conclude that the custom of walking several
hours before breakfast, and meeting the morning breezes from the sea
along these cool and refreshing shores, the probability of meeting with
choice of companions as an inducement to these early rambles, the
perpetual cheerfulness indulged by society entirely disengaged from
business and care, and their various inventions to chase away languor,
probably contribute no less to the health of the company than the
peculiar virtues of the healing spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth can commonly be found underlying superstition. The power,
possessed by certain aspects of external nature to soothe the troubles
of the mind, is one of the commonplaces of modern poetry. This thought,
when rendered into folklore, becomes the idea that certain spots are
&ldquo;places of safety from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>supernatural visitants.&rdquo;
Such was the belief connected with Our Lady&rsquo;s Well, at
Threshfield, near Linton, in Craven, Yorkshire. Whoever took refuge
there was free from the power of magical spells. When sailing among the
sea-lochs of Lewis, MacCulloch had an experience which he thus
describes in his &ldquo;<i>Western Islands</i>&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;On
one occasion the water was like a mirror, but black as jet, from its
depth and from the shadow of the high cliffs which overhung it. The
tide, flowing with the rapidity of a torrent, glided past without a
ripple to indicate its movement, while the sail aloft was filled by a
breeze that did not reach the surface. There was a death-like silence
while the boat shot along under the dark rocks like an arrow; to a
poetical imagination it might have appeared under a supernatural
influence: like the bark of Dante, angel-borne.&rdquo; If such were the
reflections of an educated man like MacCulloch, what must have been the
thoughts of our ignorant forefathers when confronted by the
ever-recurring marvels of the outer world! Nature is still
misinterpreted by credulous people through a lack of knowledge of her
laws. A good example of this, bearing, not, however, on water, but on
tree-worship, is given by Dr. J. Fergusson, in his &ldquo;<i>Tree and
Serpent Worship</i>.&rdquo; A god was said to have appeared in a
certain date-palm in a village a few miles from Tessore, and the tree
was promptly adorned by the Brahmins with garlands and offerings. Dr.
Fergusson observes:&mdash;&ldquo;On my inquiring how the god manifested
his presence, I was informed that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>soon after the sun rose in
the morning, the tree raised its head to welcome him, and bowed it down
again when he departed. As this was a miracle easily tested, I returned
at noon and found it was so. After a little study and investigation,
the mystery did not seem difficult of explanation. The tree had
originally grown across the principal pathway through the village, but
at last hung so low that, in order to enable people to pass under it,
it had been turned aside and fastened parallel to the road. In the
operation the bundle of fibres which composed the root had become
twisted like the strands of a rope. When the morning sun struck on the
upper surface of them, they contracted in drying, and hence a tendency
to untwist, which raised the head of the tree. With the evening dews
they relaxed, and the head of the tree declined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the chapter on &ldquo;Some Wonderful Wells,&rdquo; we glanced at
the mysterious origin of certain springs. In ancient times, no less
than in the present, strange sights must have been witnessed. <i>We</i>
have not a monopoly of thunderstorms, earthquakes, landslips, or
deluges of rain. The same phenomena prevailed in early times. The
difference is, that we have science to keep them in their proper place.
During the heavy rains of January 1892, a spring near the house of
Rurach, at Kintail, in Ross-shire, suddenly burst its bounds and became
a raging torrent. Usually the surplus water from the spring flowed away
in the form of a trickling stream, but on the occasion in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>question it rushed on with such force and volume
that it scooped out a channel twenty feet deep and forty feet broad.
The event not unnaturally caused a good deal of wonder in the
neighbourhood. Had it happened several centuries earlier, some
malignant water-spirit would doubtless have been reckoned the active
agent. During the operations connected with the formation of the
railway tunnel through Moncrieff Hill, close to Perth, the water of a
certain spring in the neighbourhood suddenly failed. It happened that a
clergyman, whose manse stood not far from the spring, sent, when in the
extremity of illness, for a draught of its water. It was his last
draught. He died immediately after; and at the same time, the spring
dried up. The coincidence did not pass without remark in the district,
but whether or not it gave rise to a superstition we do not know. In
the dark ages it certainly would have done so. In the annals of
hagiology, the early saints were associated in a special way with
water. They had, for instance, the power of allaying storms. St.
Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, exercised this power more than
once. Adamnan records the same miracle in connection with Columba,
abbot of Iona; and Cainneck, abbot of Aghaboe. According to a
Shropshire legend, Milburga, when followed by a certain prince, was
saved from her unwelcome pursuer by the river Corve rising in flood
after she had crossed.</p>
<p>The superstition that water, under certain circumstances,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>assumed the hue of blood, as in the case of St.
Tredwell&rsquo;s Loch in Orkney, &amp;c., claims special attention. We
call this belief a superstition, inasmuch as a special miracle was
thought to be involved in the matter; but we nowadays know, that such
appearances show themselves without any miracle at all, except the
constant miracle without which there would be no natural law. Modern
bacteriology has proved the existence of a certain microscopic plant,
technically styled <i>H&aelig;matococcus Pluvialis</i> and popularly
known in Germany as <i>Blutalge</i>. In &ldquo;<i>Notes and
Queries</i>&rdquo; for 12th March, 1892, Dr. G. H. F. Nuttall of
Baltimore, observes:&mdash;&ldquo;In Central Europe it has been found
in pools formed by the rain in rocky hollows and stone troughs, &amp;c.
<i>H&aelig;matococcus</i> often becomes intimately mixed with the
pollen of conifers and minute particles of plants which are known to be
carried hundreds of miles by occasional currents of air. The rain drops
in the heavens condense about such minute particles, and in falling,
carry them down to the earth&rsquo;s surface, where, under proper
conditions, these little plants multiply with enormous rapidity.&rdquo;
Dr. Nuttall adds, &ldquo;Besides the <i>H&aelig;matococcus
Pluvialis</i>, we have a Bacterium which has often deceived people into
the belief that they were dealing with <i>bona-fide</i> blood. This
Bacterium is easily cultivated in the laboratory. It is one of the
so-called chromogenic or colour-producing Bacteria, and bears the name
<i>Bacillus Prodigiosus</i>, on account of its exceedingly rapid
growth. This very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331"
name="pb331">331</a>]</span>minute plant has undoubtedly been the cause
of terror among superstitious people. The organism will only produce
its colour in the presence of oxygen, and, as a consequence, red spots
appear only on the surface of the moist nutrient medium on which it may
fall.&rdquo; Undoubtedly some such explanation would account for
certain red spots, alluded to by Mr. Hunt, which appeared from time to
time on the stones in the churchyard of the Cornish parish of St.
Denis. According to the belief of the district, the spots were marks of
blood, and their appearance foretold the occurrence of some untoward
event in English history.</p>
<p>We have spoken of the guardian spirits of lochs and springs. That
such spirits should have been thought to exist is not <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3682" title="Source: suprising">surprising</span>.
Since water is one of the necessaries of life for man and beast,
animals had to frequent pools and rivers. What more natural than that,
in days of ignorance, these animals should have been regarded as in
some mysterious way connected with the spots they frequented. In the
same way, fish darting about in the water would be considered its
indwelling spirits. It may not seem to us at all needful, that lochs
and springs should have guardian spirits at all. But man, in a certain
stage of development, thinks of nature, organic and inorganic alike, as
having a life akin to his own, with powers superior to his own. From a
belief in guardian spirits, to a belief in the necessity of offering
gifts to them is an easy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>transition. A present is sometimes
an expression of good-will, sometimes of a desire to obtain benefits to
the giver. Offerings at lochs and springs were undoubtedly of the
latter class, and were intended either to avert evil or to procure
good.</p>
<p>In ancient times in India, when a dragon presided over a spring, the
people of the district were in the habit of invoking his aid, when they
wanted rain or fine weather. Certain ceremonies were necessary to
procure the boon. &ldquo;The chief characteristic of the serpents
throughout the East in all ages,&rdquo; remarks Dr. Fergusson,
&ldquo;seems to have been their power over the wind and the rain, which
they exert for either good or evil as their disposition prompts.&rdquo;
As we have seen, certain wells in our own land could control the
weather. This was so, even when the guardian spirit of the spring
assumed no definite shape. The rites required to obtain the desired
object were nothing less than an acknowledgment of the spirit&rsquo;s
existence. The origin of the connection between weather and wells can
only be guessed at. It appears that the splashing of a spring when an
object was thrown into it, or the sprinkling of the water over the
neighbouring ground, was thought to cause rain, through what may be
called a dramatic representation of a shower. Why this should have been
so, cannot be determined with certainty. Probably accidental acts of
the kind described were followed, in some instances, by a fall of rain,
and the belief may have sprung up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333"
href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>that between the two there
existed the relation of cause and effect. There was thus a confusion
between what logicians call the <i lang="la">post hoc</i> and the
<i lang="la">propter hoc</i>. The same explanation may perhaps account
for the belief that a favourable breeze could be obtained, as in the
case of the Gigha Well, by the performance of certain definite
rites.</p>
<p>Few circumstances in life have more power to arrest attention than
coincidences. Two events occur about the same time, and we exclaim,
&ldquo;What a singular coincidence!&rdquo; that is, if we are not of a
superstitious temperament. If we are, we talk mysteriously about omens
and such like direful topics. To some minds, an omen has a peculiar
fascination. It lifts them above the level of their ordinary daily
life. The postman rings the bell, and letters are handed in. A message
boy is seen at the door, and a parcel is delivered. These, and many
more such, are incidents of frequent occurrence. They are reckoned
commonplace. We know all about them. But let anything unusual happen,
anything that stirs the sense of awe within us, we, at least some of
us, instantly conclude that there is magic in the matter. An
unprepossessing old woman takes a look at a child when passing. The
child ceases to thrive. There are whispers about &ldquo;the evil
eye.&rdquo; Yes, there is no doubt about it. The child must have been
bewitched. Is it not probable that the prophetic power ascribed to
wells may be accounted for on this principle? Certain appearances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>were observed, and certain events followed.
Water gushed freely from a spring, when drawn for the use of an
invalid. The invalid recovered. Of course he did, for the omen was
favourable. As in private, so in public matters. Pools of water were
observed to have something peculiar about them. Some crisis in the
history of our nation soon succeeded. What sensible person could fail
to discern a connection between the two sets of circumstances? So men,
even some wise ones, have argued.</p>
<p>Wishing-wells, from their very nature, have a special claim on
popular credulity. When a desire is eagerly cherished, we leave no
stone unturned to bring about its fulfilment. There is something, be it
what it may, that we eagerly covet. How are we to get it? In the stir
and pressure of our day&rsquo;s work, we do not see any avenue leading
to the fulfilment of our wish. In the quiet morning or evening, when
the birds are singing overhead, we go alone to some woodland well, and
there, by the margin, gather our thoughts together. One particular
thought lies close to our heart, and on it we fix our attention. In the
still moments, while we listen to the bubbling spring, our mind lights
on a clew, and our thoughts follow it into the future. We brace
ourselves up for following it in reality. We see how our design may be
accomplished. We take the road that has been revealed to our inward
eye, and finally reach the goal of our desire. How does this come
about? We may have stooped over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>spring, and with
certain accompanying rites, have breathed our wish. We return to our
daily work with the desire still lying close to our heart. Days, or
weeks, or months pass, and at last, behold, what we were so anxious
for, is ours! The charm has been successful. Of course it has. But what
of the impulse towards definite action that came to us, when we were
free from the touch of our ordinary troubles, and quiet-voiced Nature
was our teacher and our own soul our prophet? At any rate, we went to
the wishing well, and the boon we sought we can now call our own. The
question remains, are all desires granted, either through visits to
wishing-wells or in any other way? The experiences of life give a
definite answer in the negative. How then are believers in the power of
wishing-wells to account for such failures? The rites were duly
attended to, yet there was no result. Why was the charm not effectual?
Any sincere answer to the question ought to be an acknowledgment of
ignorance.</p>
<p>In thus attempting to explain the philosophy of wishing-wells, we do
not imply that the subjective element is the secret of success in every
case. We are merely pointing out that it may be so in some cases. In
other cases, according to the principle mentioned above, an explanation
will be supplied by the theory of coincidences. When trees and springs
were alike reckoned divinities, it was natural enough to conclude, that
any tree, overshadowing a spring, was somehow <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>mysteriously connected with it. Belief in such
mysterious relations continued, as we have seen, even after
tree-worship ceased as a popular cult. Certain superstitions, still in
vogue in the west, are undoubtedly relics of tree-worship. In India and
some other Eastern lands, the cult still nourishes vigorously. A writer
in the &ldquo;<i>Cornhill Magazine</i>&rdquo; for November, 1872,
remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;The contrast between the acknowledged hatred of
trees as a rule by the Bygas (an important tribe in Central India), and
their deep veneration for certain others in particular, is very
curious. I have seen the hillsides swept clear of forests for miles,
with but here and there a solitary tree left standing. These remain now
the objects of the deepest veneration; so far from being injured, they
are carefully preserved, and receive offerings of food, clothes, and
flowers, from the passing Bygas, who firmly believe that tree to be the
home of a spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need not linger over the consideration of charm-stones in their
connection with wells. In some instances, like that of the Lee Penny,
they gave efficacy to water as a healing agent; but in others, as in
the case of the Loch Torridon Spring, water gave efficacy to them.
Indeed, they acted and reacted on each other in such a way that, in
some instances, it is difficult to determine whether the talisman
brought healing virtue to the water, or <i>vice versa</i>. To find the
solution of the problem, we should have to carry our thoughts back to
the remote days when stones <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>and wells had a life of their own,
and were thus qualified to act independently.</p>
<p>One can understand why holy wells retained their popularity. Even
though they did not always effect a cure, people continued to believe
in them and to seek their aid. Consecrated springs might throw cold
water (metaphorically) on many a cherished hope; but, for all that,
they remained, as of old, objects of reverence. The secret of their
power lay in their appeal to the imagination. Understanding might say,
it is absurd to expect that my ailment can be removed in this way; but
imagination protested that there are more things in heaven and earth
than are dreamed of in my philosophy. The rites to be gone
through&mdash;the choice of the fitting season, the keeping of silence,
the leaving of a gift&mdash;all conduced to throw a halo of romance
around the practice. There was thus an appeal to the unknown and
mysterious, that gave to well-worship a strange charm. It stirred up
any latent poetry in a man&rsquo;s nature, and linked him to something
beyond himself. Springs have a double charm. They are interesting for
their own sake, and for the sake of the folklore that has gathered
round them. They are &ldquo;like roses, beautiful in themselves, that
add to their own perfection the exquisite loveliness of a mossy
dell.&rdquo; In conclusion, take away what is distinctively
medi&aelig;val in well-worship, and paganism is left. We find this
paganism entering like a wedge into the substance of a Christian
civilisation. It may have changed its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>colour, but it is
paganism notwithstanding. Well-worship has a definite value as a
survival. It serves to unite our own age of science with one in the far
past, when laws of nature, as we understand them, were unknown. As a
cult it has forsaken the busy haunts of men, but lingers still in quiet
places, especially among the mountains. Superstitions die hard. The
epitaph of this one has still to be written. Those who are waiting for
its last breath need not be surprised if they have to wait yet a while.
